## What is Window Flashing?

Window flashing is a process of installing a waterproof material around the edges of a window or door to keep water out. The material is usually a thin sheet of plastic or rubber that is applied to the window frame and sealed with a special adhesive. This creates an airtight seal that prevents water from entering the home through the window.

## Benefits of Flashing a Window

There are several benefits to flashing a window, including improved energy efficiency, increased air-tightness, and reduced risk of water damage. Flashing a window can help to reduce energy costs by preventing air leakage, which can cause drafts and make it harder to keep the home at a comfortable temperature. It also helps to protect the home from water damage, as the flashing will keep water out of the walls and floors.

If you're interested in flashing a window, here are the steps to follow: 

1. Choose the appropriate flashing material. 
2. Measure and cut the flashing to fit the window frame.
