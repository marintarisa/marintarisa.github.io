## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the secret to making a paper airplane that flies left every time?**

**A1:** The secret to making a paper airplane that flies left every time is to fold the wings in such a way that the left wing is larger than the right wing. This will cause the paper airplane to fly in a leftward direction.

**Q2: How do you fold the wings to make the paper airplane fly left?**

**A2:** To fold the wings to make the paper airplane fly left, start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the left wing up and the right wing down. This will create a larger left wing and a smaller right wing, which will cause the paper airplane to fly left.

**Q3: What type of paper is best for making a paper airplane?**

**A3:** The best type of paper for making a paper airplane is lightweight, thin paper such as copy paper or printer paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper will be too heavy and will not fly as well.

**Q4: How can I make my paper airplane fly farther?**

**A4:** To make your paper airplane fly farther, make sure the wings are evenly balanced and that the paper is lightweight. You can also experiment with different shapes and sizes of wings to find the combination that will give the paper airplane the best flight.

**Q5: How can I make my paper airplane fly higher?**

**A5:** To make your paper airplane fly higher, make sure the wings are evenly balanced and that the paper is lightweight. You can also experiment with different shapes and sizes of wings to find the combination that will give the paper airplane the best lift. Additionally, adding a weight to the nose of the paper airplane can help it fly higher.
