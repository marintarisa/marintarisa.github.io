### Measuring and Cutting the Tiles
Once the surface is prepared, you can measure and cut the tiles to the desired size and shape. If you’re using self-adhesive tiles, you should also make sure to leave a gap between the tiles to allow for expansion.

### Applying the Adhesive
If you’re not using self-adhesive tiles, you’ll need to mix and apply adhesive to the back of the tiles. Make sure to follow the instructions on the adhesive package for best results.

### Laying the Tiles in the Desired Pattern
Once the adhesive is applied, you can start laying the tiles in the desired pattern. Make sure to press the tiles firmly into place to ensure a secure bond.
