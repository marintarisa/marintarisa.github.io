## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to becoming a paper airplane flying master?**

**A1:** The trick is to fold the paper in a way that creates a symmetrical and aerodynamic design. This will help the paper airplane fly farther and straighter.

**Q2: What type of paper should be used to make a paper airplane?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use is a lightweight paper, such as printer paper or construction paper. Heavier paper, such as cardstock, is too heavy and will not fly as well. 

**Q3: How do you make a paper airplane?**

**A3:** To make a paper airplane, start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the top corners down to the center crease. Finally, fold the bottom of the paper up to the top corners.

**Q4: What are some tips to make a paper airplane fly better?**

**A4:** To make a paper airplane fly better, make sure the wings are even and symmetrical. Also, try adding a weight to the nose of the plane to help it stay balanced. Finally, experiment with different designs to find the one that works best for you.

**Q5: How far can a paper airplane fly?**

**A5:** The distance a paper airplane can fly depends on the design and weight of the plane, as well as the strength of the wind. Generally, a well-designed paper airplane can fly up to 30 feet.
