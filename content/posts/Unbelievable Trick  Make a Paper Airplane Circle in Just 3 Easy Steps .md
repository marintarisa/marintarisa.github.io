## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make a paper airplane that can fly in a circle? It may sound impossible, but it’s actually easy to do. In just three easy steps, you can create a paper airplane that circles back to you. Here’s how you do it. 

## Definition of a Paper Airplane 

A paper airplane is a toy aircraft made out of a single sheet of paper. It is usually made by folding the paper into a triangular shape and then throwing it. Paper airplanes are a popular pastime and are often used in competitions to see who can make the farthest-flying airplane. 

## Benefits of Making Paper Airplanes

Making paper airplanes is a fun and creative activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It can also help to develop problem-solving and motor skills. Additionally, paper airplanes are a great way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. 

## Overview of the Trick

This trick involves creating a paper airplane, flying it in a circular motion, and then enjoying the flight. In the following sections, we’ll go into more detail about each step. 

## Step 1: Create the Plane

The first step is to gather the necessary materials. You’ll need a single sheet of paper, scissors, and tape. Once you have these materials, fold the paper into a triangular shape. This will be the body of your plane. Once you’ve finished folding, test the plane’s flight by throwing it. Make sure the plane is able to fly straight before you move on to the next step. 

## Step 2: Fly the Plane in a Circle

The next step is to find a large, open space. This could be a park, a field, or even your backyard. Once you’ve found a suitable space, throw the plane in a circular motion. As the plane is flying, adjust its flight by gently pushing it in the direction you want it to go. 

## Step 3: Enjoy the Flight

Once the plane is flying in a circular motion, sit back and enjoy the flight. Watch as the plane circles around you. If the plane starts to veer off course, gently adjust its flight as needed. When the plane has completed its circle, celebrate your successful flight! 

## Conclusion

Creating a paper airplane that can fly in a circle is a fun and creative activity. It requires problem-solving and motor skills, and can help to explore the principles of aerodynamics. To do this trick, you’ll need to create the plane, fly it in a circular motion, and then enjoy the flight. With a bit of practice, you’ll be able to master this trick in no time.
