## Definition of a Paper Plane

A paper plane, also known as a paper airplane, is a flat object made from a sheet of paper or paperboard that is usually propelled by throwing or launching. It is a form of aerodynamic lift, the force that allows an aircraft to fly. 

## Benefits of Making Paper Planes

Making paper planes is a great way to explore the principles of flight. It can also be used to teach children basic physics concepts such as lift and drag. Additionally, itâ€™s a fun and creative way to pass the time. 

## Steps to Making a Paper Plane

1. Gather materials: You will need a sheet of paper or paperboard, scissors, and tape (optional). 

2. Fold the paper: Fold the paper in half lengthwise, then unfold it. Next, fold each of the top corners down to the center crease. Then, fold the paper in half again and crease the edges. 

3. Add finishing touches: You can add tape to the wings for extra strength. You can also use scissors to make small cuts in the wings for improved aerodynamics. 

## Conclusion

Making paper planes is a fun and easy activity that anyone can do. With a few simple steps, you can become an expert in no time. By following the steps outlined above, you can learn the basics of aerodynamics and have a great time in the process. So grab a sheet of paper and get folding!
