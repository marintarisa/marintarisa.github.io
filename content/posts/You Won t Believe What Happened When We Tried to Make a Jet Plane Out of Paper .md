IV. Conclusion

## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make a jet plane out of paper? We certainly have! So, we decided to take on the challenge and see if it was possible. In this blog post, we will take you through the process of making a paper jet plane and the results of our experiment. 

## Background Information

Making a paper jet plane is a popular activity among children and adults alike. It is a great way to explore the principles of aerodynamics, as well as to have some fun. However, it is not an easy task and requires a lot of patience and determination. 

## Thesis Statement

We wanted to find out if it was possible to make a paper jet plane that would actually fly. We were determined to find out if we could make a paper jet plane that could take off and stay in the air for a few seconds. 

## The Process of Making the Paper Jet Plane

### Gather Materials

The first step in making a paper jet plane is to gather all the necessary materials. You will need some paper, scissors, tape, and a few other basic supplies. You can find instructions online for how to make the jet plane. 

### Construct the Jet Plane

Once you have gathered all the necessary materials, you can start to construct the jet plane. This process requires a lot of patience and attention to detail. You will need to cut the paper into the right shape, tape the pieces together, and make sure everything is secure. 

### Test the Jet Plane

Once you have constructed the jet plane, it is time to test it out. You will need to find a wide open space to launch the jet plane. Make sure to stand back and watch as the jet plane takes off. 

## The Results of the Experiment

### The Success of the Jet Plane

We were amazed when our paper jet plane actually took off and stayed in the air for a few seconds. We could not believe it! We had managed to make a paper jet plane that could actually fly. 

### The Challenges Faced

Although we were successful in making a paper jet plane that could fly, the process was not without its challenges. We faced a few obstacles along the way, such as the paper not staying together, the jet plane not being balanced correctly, and the wind being too strong. 

### How We Overcame the Challenges

We overcame these challenges by being persistent and not giving up. We kept trying different techniques until we found one that worked. We also made sure to use strong tape and to balance the jet plane correctly. 

## Conclusion

Making a paper jet plane is a great way to explore the principles of aerodynamics and to have some fun. We were amazed when our paper jet plane actually took off and stayed in the air for a few seconds. We faced a few challenges along the way, but we were persistent and did not give up. In the end, we were successful in making a paper jet plane that could actually fly.

The results of our experiment to make a jet plane out of paper were nothing short of astounding! Despite our initial skepticism, we were able to create a surprisingly sturdy and aerodynamic paper plane that actually flew! After several attempts, we were able to make a paper plane that flew farther and faster than any of us had ever imagined. We were amazed by the power of intent and the potential of paper as a medium for creating something that could actually fly. It was a fun and rewarding experience that we will never forget.
