## Step 3: Throw the Paper Airplane

Once the paper airplane is folded, it is time to throw it! Make sure to aim for distance, and adjust the angles of the wings and tail to get the best results.

## Step 4: Measure the Distance

The final step is to measure the distance of your paper airplane. Use a measuring tape to measure the distance, and then compare it to the world record. If you have exceeded the world record, then congratulations! You have made a world record paper airplane!

## Conclusion

Making a world record paper airplane is an exciting and rewarding experience. With the right materials, steps, and techniques, you can make an incredible paper airplane that will make a world record! Remember to aim for distance, adjust the angles, and measure the distance accurately. Good luck!
