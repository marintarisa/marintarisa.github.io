A paper plane, also known as a paper aeroplane, is a type of model aircraft that is made from a single sheet of paper or card stock. Paper planes are typically used as toys, but they can also be used for educational purposes or as a form of art.

### Benefits of Paper Plane

Paper planes provide a variety of benefits. They can be used for recreational activities, such as playing catch or racing. They can also be used as a teaching tool to help children understand the basics of aerodynamics. Additionally, paper planes can be used as a form of art, as they can be decorated with various materials and designs.

### Statement of the Trick

The trick we will be discussing today is a simple way to make a paper plane with just one simple step. This trick is easy to learn and can be used to make a variety of different paper plane designs. 

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Now that we've discussed the basics of paper plane construction and the simple trick we'll be using, let's get started!

### Gather Necessary Materials

The first step is to gather the necessary materials. You will need one sheet of paper or card stock, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. 

### Fold the Paper in Half

Once you have the materials, you'll need to fold the paper in half. To do this, take one end of the paper and fold it over the other end. Make sure the two sides of the paper line up evenly.

### Make the Wings

Once the paper is folded in half, you'll need to make the wings. To do this, take the two sides of the paper and fold them up so that they meet in the middle. Make sure the wings are even and symmetrical.

### Create the Nose

The last step is to create the nose of the paper plane. To do this, take the end of the paper and fold it up so that it forms a point. Make sure the point is sharp and even.

## Conclusion

Making a paper plane with just one simple step is easy and fun! This trick is great for making a variety of different paper plane designs.
