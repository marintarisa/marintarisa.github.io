## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
<h2>Q: What is the trick to make a paper airplane fly farther?</h2>

<h3>A: The trick is to make sure that the paper airplane is properly balanced and that the wings are symmetrical. The wings should be curved slightly up in the front and slightly down in the back. This helps the paper airplane to gain lift and fly farther. </h3>

<h2>Q: What kind of paper should I use for a paper airplane?</h2>

<h3>A: You should use a lightweight paper such as printer paper, construction paper, or tissue paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock or poster board will make the paper airplane too heavy and it won't fly as far. </h3>

<h2>Q: How do I make sure my paper airplane is balanced?</h2>

<h3>A: You can make sure your paper airplane is balanced by folding it in half and making sure that the wings are symmetrical. You can also use a ruler or other straight edge to make sure the wings are even. </h3>

<h2>Q: What other tips can I use to make my paper airplane fly farther?</h2>

<h3>A: You can make sure the paper airplane is properly folded and that the wings are symmetrical. You can also make sure that the nose of the paper airplane is pointed and that the wings are curved slightly up in the front and slightly down in the back. This will help the paper airplane to gain lift and fly farther. </h3>

<h2>Q: Can I use any type of paper to make a paper airplane?</h2>

<h3>A: You should use a lightweight paper such as printer paper, construction paper, or tissue paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock or poster board will make the paper airplane too heavy and it won't fly as far. </h3>
