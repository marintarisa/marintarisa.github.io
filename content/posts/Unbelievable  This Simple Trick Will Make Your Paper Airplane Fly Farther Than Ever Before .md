## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to make a paper airplane fly farther?**

**A1:** The trick is to make sure that the paper airplane has a symmetrical shape, with the wings and tail balanced, so that it can fly in a straight line. Additionally, adding a few paperclips to the nose of the plane will give it extra weight, which will help it fly farther. 

**Q2: What kind of paper should I use to make a paper airplane?**

**A2:** It's best to use a heavier weight paper, such as cardstock or construction paper, as it will be more durable and will hold its shape better. Additionally, using a slightly larger piece of paper can help the plane fly farther. 

**Q3: Are there any other tips to make a paper airplane fly farther?**

**A3:** Yes! Make sure that the wings and tail are symmetrical, and that the plane is properly balanced. Additionally, adding a few paperclips to the nose of the plane can help it fly farther. 

**Q4: How do I know if my paper airplane is properly balanced?**

**A4:** The best way to check if your paper airplane is properly balanced is to hold it up and make sure that the wings and tail are symmetrical. If it is balanced, it should fly in a straight line. 

**Q5: How do I know if my paper airplane flew farther than before?**

**A5:** You can measure the distance that your paper airplane flew with a measuring tape or a ruler. Additionally, you can compare the distance that your paper airplane flew with the distance of other paper airplanes to see which one flew the farthest.
