## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to make paper airplanes soar?**

**A1:** The trick is to make sure the wings are properly balanced and the nose of the plane is slightly tilted to create lift. Additionally, adding a paper clip to the nose of the plane can help it stay in the air longer. 

**Q2: How do I balance the wings of the paper airplane?**

**A2:** To properly balance the wings, fold the wings at the same angle and ensure they are symmetrical. You can also adjust the angle of the wings to make the plane more stable in the air. 

**Q3: What type of paper should I use for the airplane?**

**A3:** Heavyweight paper such as cardstock or construction paper is best for making paper airplanes. Using a thicker paper will make the plane more durable and able to stay in the air longer. 

**Q4: What is the best way to launch the paper airplane?**

**A4:** The best way to launch a paper airplane is to hold it by the tail and gently toss it into the air. It is important to make sure the nose of the plane is tilted slightly up to create lift. 

**Q5: How can I make my paper airplane go farther?**

**A5:** To make your paper airplane go farther, you can add a paper clip to the nose of the plane. This will add weight to the front of the plane, which will help it stay in the air longer. Additionally, make sure the wings are properly balanced and the nose is slightly tilted to create lift.
