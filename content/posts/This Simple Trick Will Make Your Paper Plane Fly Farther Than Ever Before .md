,IV. Conclusion

## Introduction
Paper planes are a fun and simple way to pass the time and have a little friendly competition with friends. But if you want to really impress your friends, you can make your paper plane fly farther than ever before! All you need is a few simple materials and a few easy steps. 

## Materials Needed
Paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler are all you need to make the perfect paper plane. 

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Start with a piece of 8.5 x 11-inch paper.
2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise.
3. Unfold the paper and fold the top two corners to the center line.
4. Fold the paper in half again, so the two triangles meet in the middle.
5. Cut off the excess paper from the two triangles.
6. Fold the two sides of the paper up at a 45 degree angle.
7. Tape the two sides together.
8. Cut off the excess paper from the back of the plane.
9. Add a small piece of tape to the nose of the plane for extra weight.

## Conclusion
Now youâ€™re ready to fly! With the extra weight in the nose, your paper plane should fly farther than ever before. Have fun and happy flying!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make a paper plane fly farther?**

**A1:** The simple trick is to add a slight bend to the wings of the paper plane. This will create more lift and help the plane fly farther.

**Q2: How much of a bend should I add to the wings of the plane?**

**A2:** The bend should be slight, about 1-2 cm. Any more than that can cause the plane to become unstable and lose lift.

**Q3: What type of paper should I use for the plane?**

**A3:** Heavier paper will work best for the plane. Regular printer paper is usually too light and won't fly as far.

**Q4: Is there any other way to make the plane fly farther?**

**A4:** Yes, you can also add a tail to the plane. This will help stabilize the plane and increase its range.

**Q5: Is there any way to make the plane fly faster?**

**A5:** Yes, you can add a weight to the nose of the plane. This will help the plane fly faster and farther.
