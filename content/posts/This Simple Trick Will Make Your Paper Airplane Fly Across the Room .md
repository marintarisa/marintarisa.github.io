## Introduction

Paper airplanes are a fun and easy way to have some fun indoors. With just a few folds and some imagination, you can make a paper airplane that will soar across the room. But if you want your paper airplane to really take off, then you need to try this simple trick!

## Definition of Paper Airplane

A paper airplane is a type of paper craft that is made by folding a flat sheet of paper into a variety of shapes. The most common type of paper airplane is the “dart”, which is made by folding the paper in half lengthwise and then folding the two halves together to form a triangle shape.

## Description of Simple Trick

The simple trick to making your paper airplane fly farther is to add weight to the nose of the plane. This can be done by adding a small piece of paper or a paperclip to the nose of the plane. This added weight will help the plane fly farther and faster.

## Explanation of Trick

The trick to making your paper airplane fly farther is to add weight to the nose of the plane. This added weight will help the plane fly farther and faster. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to add weight to your paper airplane:

1. Start by folding your paper into a “dart” shape.
2. Cut a small piece of paper or a paperclip into a triangular shape.
3. Glue the triangular shape to the nose of the plane.
4. Let the glue dry before throwing the plane.

## Tips for Best Results

When adding weight to the nose of your paper airplane, make sure to use a light material such as paper or a paperclip. Heavier materials such as coins or rocks will make the plane too heavy to fly. It is also important to make sure that the weight is evenly distributed on the nose of the plane.

## Conclusion

By adding a small piece of paper or a paperclip to the nose of your paper airplane, you can make it fly farther and faster. This simple trick is easy to do and can make your paper airplane a lot more fun to fly. So next time you make a paper airplane, give this trick a try and see how far it can fly!
