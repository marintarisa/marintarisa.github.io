## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is a catalytic converter?**

**A1:** A catalytic converter is an emissions control device that reduces toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine into less-toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction.

**Q2: How does a catalytic converter work?**

**A2:** A catalytic converter works by passing the exhaust gas from the engine through a ceramic or metal honeycomb-shaped structure, which is coated with a catalyst, such as platinum, palladium, or rhodium. The catalyst causes a chemical reaction, which oxidizes the pollutants in the exhaust gas into less-toxic pollutants.

**Q3: What is the purpose of a catalytic converter?**

**A3:** The purpose of a catalytic converter is to reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere from an internal combustion engine. Catalytic converters are an important part of vehicle emissions control systems, which help reduce air pollution.

**Q4: Can you spell 'catalytic converter'?**

**A4:** Yes, the correct spelling is "catalytic converter."

**Q5: What are the main components of a catalytic converter?**

**A5:** The main components of a catalytic converter are a ceramic or metal honeycomb-shaped structure, a catalyst such as platinum, palladium, or rhodium, and a substrate that helps to hold the catalyst in place.
