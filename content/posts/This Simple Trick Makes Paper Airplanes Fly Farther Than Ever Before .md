## Definition of a Paper Airplane

A paper airplane is a toy aircraft made out of paper or cardboard. It is typically constructed by folding a piece of paper or cardboard into a triangular or rectangular shape. The plane is then launched by throwing it into the air.

## Overview of the Simple Trick

The simple trick to make your paper airplanes fly farther than ever before is to add weight to the plane. This can be done by adding a few coins or paperclips to the plane, or by using a heavier paper or cardboard. This added weight helps the plane to glide through the air more efficiently, which allows it to cover a greater distance.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Gathering Materials

To make your paper airplane fly farther than ever before, you will need a piece of paper or cardboard, a few coins or paperclips, and some tape or glue.

### Constructing the Plane

Fold the paper or cardboard into a triangular or rectangular shape. Make sure that all of the folds are tight and secure.

### Adding Weight

Add the coins or paperclips to the plane. Use tape or glue to secure them in place.

### Releasing the Plane

Once the plane is constructed and weighted, it is ready to be launched. Throw the plane into the air and watch it soar!

## Conclusion

The simple trick of adding weight to your paper airplanes can make them fly farther than ever before. This trick is easy to do, and it can provide hours of fun and entertainment. So next time you want to make your paper airplanes fly farther, try adding a few coins or paperclips to the plane!
