## Introduction
Are you looking for a fun and easy way to entertain yourself or your kids? Look no further than paper airplanes! With just a few folds, you can have a plane that can soar through the sky. But if you want to make your paper airplane fly farther than ever before, then this simple trick is for you!

## Background Information
Paper airplanes have been around since the early 1900s, when they were first used to demonstrate the basics of aerodynamics. Since then, they have become a popular pastime for children and adults alike. And while there are many different ways to fold a paper airplane, they all share the same basic principles of aerodynamics.

## Purpose of the Paper
The purpose of this paper is to explain how to make a paper airplane that will fly farther than ever before. We will provide step-by-step directions for folding the plane, as well as tips for maximizing its flight distance.

## How to Make a Paper Airplane
There are many different ways to fold a paper airplane, but the following method is the most effective for maximizing flight distance.

### Step-by-Step Directions
1. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise.
2. Fold the top corners in towards the center line.
3. Fold the bottom corners in towards the center line.
4. Fold the paper in half again, this time widthwise.
5. Fold the top corners in towards the center line.
6. Fold the bottom corners in towards the center line.
7. Fold the paper in half one more time, lengthwise.
8. Fold the top corners in towards the center line.
9. Fold the bottom corners in towards the center line.
10. Fold the wings up to create the shape of the plane.

### Tips for Maximum Flight Distance
The most important factor in maximizing the flight distance of your paper airplane is to make sure that the wings are even and symmetrical. This will help to ensure that the plane flies in a straight line. Additionally, you should make sure that the wings are not too thick or too thin. Too thick and the plane will be too heavy to fly far, too thin and the plane will not be able to generate enough lift.

## Conclusion
Making a paper airplane that will fly farther than ever before is easy with this simple trick. All you need to do is follow the step-by-step directions and make sure that the wings are even and symmetrical. With the right technique, you can have a paper airplane that will soar through the sky like never before.
