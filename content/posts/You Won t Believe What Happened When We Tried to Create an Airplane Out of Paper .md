## Introduction

We've all heard stories of paper airplanes and their amazing feats of flight. But have you ever wondered what would happen if you tried to make an actual airplane out of paper? We decided to find out! 

## Background Information

We wanted to challenge ourselves and see if it was possible to make an actual airplane out of paper. We had heard stories of paper airplanes flying for miles, but we wanted to find out if we could make a plane that could actually fly. We gathered our materials and got to work! 

## Thesis Statement

Our goal was to create a paper airplane that was capable of flight. We wanted to find out if this was possible and what kind of results we would get. 

## Experiment and Results

### Materials Used

For our experiment, we used a variety of materials. We used paper, tape, scissors, and glue. We also used a ruler and a protractor to make sure our measurements were accurate. 

### Steps Taken

We started by drawing a blueprint of the airplane on paper. We then cut out the pieces and assembled them using tape and glue. We tested the plane by launching it off a table and observing how it flew. 

### Outcome of the Experiment

The plane flew! We were amazed by the results. The plane flew for about 20 feet and then landed safely. We were thrilled that our experiment was a success! 

## Reflection

### Challenges Encountered

Although the experiment was a success, it wasn't without its challenges. We had to make sure that all of the pieces were cut accurately and that the plane was balanced correctly. We also had to make sure that the plane was strong enough to withstand the force of the launch. 

### Lessons Learned

This experiment taught us a lot about the principles of flight. We learned how important balance and weight are when it comes to flying. We also learned that it is possible to make an airplane out of paper! 

### Future Considerations

We plan to continue experimenting with paper airplanes. We want to find out if we can make a plane that can fly farther and faster. We also want to find out if we can make a plane that is more aerodynamic. 

## Conclusion

We had a lot of fun experimenting with paper airplanes. We were amazed by the results and learned a lot about the principles of flight. We can't wait to continue our experiments and find out what else we can do with paper airplanes!

We all know that paper airplanes are a fun and creative way to pass the time, but could paper actually be used to create a real-life airplane? We were determined to find out, so we set out to create an airplane out of paper. We were confident that with enough time and effort, we could make it happen.

Unfortunately, our experiment didn't quite work out as planned. We quickly realized that paper is just too flimsy and fragile to withstand the forces of flight. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to make a paper airplane that could actually fly.

Our attempt to create an airplane out of paper showed us that the intent was admirable, but the results were far from successful. We may have failed to make an airplane out of paper, but our experiment taught us a valuable lesson about the limits of what can be achieved with paper. We may have failed this time, but we are determined to keep trying and to see what other creative solutions we can come up with.
