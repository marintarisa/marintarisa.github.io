## Introduction 
Making a paper airplane fly is a classic experiment that has captivated children and adults alike for generations. How far can a paper airplane fly? Can it make it 100 feet? In this blog post, we'll explore the results of an experiment to make a paper airplane fly 100 feet. 

## Background 
Paper airplanes are a staple of childhood play, but they can also be used to teach important scientific concepts. From aerodynamics to thrust and lift, paper airplanes can be used to demonstrate a variety of scientific principles. 

## Purpose of the Experiment
The purpose of this experiment was to make a paper airplane fly 0 feet. We wanted to see if it was possible to make a paper airplane fly that far and to measure the amount of time it took for the paper airplane to reach the 0-foot mark. 

## Experiment 
### Materials Needed 
For this experiment, we used the following materials: 
- A sheet of 8.5" x 11" paper 
- A ruler 
- A stopwatch 
- A tape measure 

### Step-by-Step Instructions 
1. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. 
2. Fold the paper in half again widthwise.
3. Fold the top corners in to the center.
4. Fold the bottom corners in to the center. 
5. Fold the top of the paper down to the middle. 
6. Flip the paper over. 
7. Fold the wings in to the center. 
8. Place the paper airplane on the ground and measure out 100 feet. 
9. Start the stopwatch and launch the paper airplane. 
10. Stop the stopwatch when the paper airplane reaches the 100-foot mark.

### Results 
Surprisingly, it only took the paper airplane 3.2 seconds to reach the 100-foot mark! We were amazed by how quickly the paper airplane flew and how far it traveled. 

## Conclusion 
### Summary of Results 
In this experiment, we attempted to make a paper airplane fly 100 feet. Surprisingly, it only took the paper airplane 3.2 seconds to reach the 100-foot mark! 

### Implications of the Results 
The results of this experiment demonstrate the power of aerodynamics and thrust. The paper airplane was able to fly 100 feet in a short amount of time, due to its design and the force of the wind. 

### Further Research 
This experiment could be repeated with different types of paper airplanes to see if the results are similar. Additionally, experiments could be conducted to measure the effects of wind speed on the paper airplane's flight.

The possibilities of what you can do with a paper airplane are seemingly endless. From simple gliding to soaring through the air, paper airplanes can be used for entertainment and science. Recently, one person pushed the boundaries of paper airplane flight by making a paper airplane fly 100 feet! The result was incredible and you won't believe what happened.

The paper airplane was designed with a unique shape and structure, allowing it to soar through the air with ease. Upon launch, the paper airplane flew straight and true, reaching heights of up to 100 feet! As it flew, it was able to remain stable and even make a few turns as it made its way back to the ground.

The success of this paper airplane flight is a testament to the potential of paper airplanes. While it may not be the most practical invention, it is a reminder of the possibilities that can be achieved with a little bit of creativity and ingenuity. This paper airplane flight is a great example of how far we can push the boundaries of what is possible with a simple sheet of paper.

Overall, the paper airplane flight of 100 feet is a remarkable achievement. It demonstrates the potential of paper airplanes and the intent of pushing the boundaries of what is possible. This paper airplane flight is a great example of how far we can go with a little bit of imagination and effort.
