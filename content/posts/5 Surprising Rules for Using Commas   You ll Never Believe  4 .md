# Introduction to Commas

Commas are an essential element of written English. They help to clarify the meaning of sentences and make them easier to read. In this blog post, we'll explore five surprising rules for using commas that you may not have known about.

## Rule 1: Using Commas to Separate Items in a List

The most basic comma rule is to use them to separate items in a list. For example: I bought apples, oranges, and bananas at the store. Here, we use commas to separate each item in the list.

## Rule 2: Using Commas to Separate Independent Clauses

An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete thought. A comma is used to separate two independent clauses when they are joined by a coordinating conjunction such as "and," "but," or "or." For example: I wanted to go to the park, but I was too tired.

## Rule 3: Using Commas to Set Off Nonessential Elements

Nonessential elements are words, phrases, or clauses that are not necessary for the sentence to make sense. They are usually set off by commas. For example: My brother, who is a doctor, lives in New York. Here, the phrase "who is a doctor" is nonessential and is set off by commas.

## Rule 4: Using Commas to Set Off Interjections

Interjections are words or phrases that express emotion and are usually followed by an exclamation point. They are usually set off by commas. For example: Wow, that was a great movie! Here, the interjection "wow" is set off by a comma.

## Rule 5: Using Commas After Introductory Elements

Introductory elements are words, phrases, or clauses that come at the beginning of a sentence. They are usually followed by a comma. For example: After dinner, we went for a walk. Here, the introductory element "after dinner" is followed by a comma.
