## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to build a jet out of paper? It may seem like an impossible task, but it's actually quite easy with the right instructions. In this blog post, we'll show you a simple trick that will have you constructing your very own paper jet in no time.

We'll start with a bit of background on paper airplanes. Then, we'll provide an overview of the simple trick we'll be using. Finally, we'll give you step-by-step instructions on how to build your own jet out of paper.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

To make your paper jet, you'll need the following materials: paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler. Once you have all of your supplies, you can begin the process of constructing your jet.

The first step is to fold your paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again. After that, make two small cuts in the center of the paper, about an inch apart.

Next, fold the top corners of the paper inwards, so that they meet in the center. Then, fold the bottom corners inwards, so that they meet in the center. Finally, fold the paper in half again, and tape the edges together.

Once your paper is folded, you'll need to cut out the wings. To do this, measure two inches from the center of the paper and draw a line across the width of the paper. Then, cut along the line to create two wings.

Now, you'll need to fold the wings. To do this, fold the wings inwards, so that the edges meet in the center. Then, fold the wings downwards, so that they form a V-shape. Finally, tape the edges of the wings together.

You now have a jet made out of paper! All that's left is to decorate it and fly it.
