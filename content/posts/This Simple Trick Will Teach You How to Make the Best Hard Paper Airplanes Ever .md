## Introduction

Making hard paper airplanes is a fun and rewarding hobby. With just some paper and a few simple steps, you can create amazing flying machines. In this article, we will explain what hard paper airplanes are, the benefits of learning how to make them, and provide a simple trick for creating the best hard paper airplanes ever!

## Definition of Hard Paper Airplanes

Hard paper airplanes are paper airplanes made with thicker paper than the standard, plain white paper. This thicker paper provides additional strength and durability, allowing the airplane to fly farther and stay in the air longer. Hard paper airplanes can be made from any type of paper, but cardstock and construction paper are the most popular choices.

## Benefits of Learning How to Make Them

Learning how to make hard paper airplanes is a great way to develop fine motor skills, problem-solving skills, and hand-eye coordination. It also encourages creativity and imagination, as you can design your own unique airplanes. Finally, it can be a great way to spend time with friends and family, as you can have competitions to see whose plane flies the farthest.

## Overview of the Simple Trick

The simple trick we’ll be sharing is a step-by-step guide to making the best hard paper airplanes ever. We’ll cover the materials needed, the instructions for folding and cutting, and how to test and adjust your airplane as needed. Let’s get started!

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Gather Materials Needed

To make the best hard paper airplanes, you’ll need the following materials: 
- Thick paper (cardstock or construction paper)
- Scissors
- Ruler
- Pen or pencil

### Follow Instructions for Folding and Cutting

1. Start by cutting a piece of paper into a rectangular shape. The size of the rectangle will depend on the size of the airplane you want to make.

2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise.

3. Fold the top corners down to meet the center crease.

4. Fold the bottom corners up to meet the center crease.

5. Fold the wings down to meet the center crease.

6. Cut along the center crease to create two wings.

7. Fold the wings up to create an airplane shape.

### Test and Adjust Airplane as Needed

Once the airplane is assembled, it’s time to test it. Throw it up in the air and see how it flies. If it’s not flying well, you can adjust the wings and tail to improve its performance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we’ve shared a simple trick for making the best hard paper airplanes ever. This trick includes gathering the materials needed, following instructions for folding and cutting, and testing and adjusting the airplane as needed. Making hard paper airplanes can be a great way to develop fine motor skills, problem-solving skills, and hand-eye coordination. It can also be a fun way to spend time with friends and family.
