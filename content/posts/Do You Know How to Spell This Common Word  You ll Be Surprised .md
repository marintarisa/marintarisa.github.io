# Do You Know How to Spell This Common Word? You'll Be Surprised!

We've all been there: you're typing a paper, an email, or a text, and you come across a word that you think you know how to spell. You type it out, and then you double-check it in the spell-checker, and it's wrong. You've just made a common spelling mistake.

## Introduction 

Today we're going to talk about one of the most commonly misspelled words in the English language: "accommodate." This is a word that is often misused and misspelled, even by native English speakers.

## Definition of the Common Word

The word "accommodate" is a verb that means "to provide for, or make room for." It is often used in the phrase "accommodate for," which means to make an adjustment or change in order to suit someone or something.

## Explanation of Why it is So Often Misspelled

The reason why "accommodate" is so often misspelled is because of its pronunciation. It is pronounced with a short "a" sound, like in the word "cat," but it is spelled with a double "c" and a double "m." This can be confusing for many people, as they might be expecting it to be spelled with an "e" instead of an "a."

## Common Misspellings

Some common misspellings of "accommodate" include "acommodate," "acomodate," and "acomodate." All of these are incorrect spellings.

## Reasons for Why These Misspellings Occur

One of the reasons why these misspellings occur is because of the way the word is pronounced. The double "c" and double "m" can be confusing for many people, and they may be tempted to replace one of the letters with an "e" instead. Another reason is that some people may be used to seeing the word spelled with an "e" instead of an "a," as in the word "accommodation."

## Tips for Correct Spelling

If you want to spell "accommodate" correctly, there are a few steps you can take. First, make sure you are pronouncing the word correctly. The double "c" and double "m" should be pronounced with a short "a" sound, like in the word "cat." You can also use a dictionary or other online resources to double-check the spelling.
