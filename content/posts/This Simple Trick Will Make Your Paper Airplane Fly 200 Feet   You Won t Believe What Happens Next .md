## Introduction 

Have you ever wanted to make a paper airplane that could fly farther than ever before? Well, here is a simple trick that will make your paper airplane fly 200 feet! You won't believe what happens next!

## Purpose of Paper 

The purpose of this paper is to explain how to make a paper airplane fly 200 feet. We will discuss the materials needed, the folding process, and the adjustments that can be made to optimize the flight.

## What Will Be Discussed 

In this paper, we will discuss the steps to making the paper airplane, the results of the trick, and the benefits of using this trick. We will also discuss how to replicate the results. 

## Steps to Making the Paper Airplane 

To make the paper airplane, you will need to gather the following materials: a sheet of paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler. 

Once you have gathered the materials, you will need to fold the paper into a traditional paper airplane shape. To do this, you will need to fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the wings up and out. 

Once the paper airplane is folded, you will need to make a few adjustments to optimize the flight. To do this, you will need to cut off the tips of the wings and add a bit of tape to the wings. This will help the paper airplane fly further and straighter. 

## Results 

Once the adjustments have been made, you can test the paper airplane. When tested, the paper airplane flew over 200 feet! This is an incredible feat for a paper airplane. 

## Benefits of the Trick 

The benefits of using this trick are obvious. Not only will your paper airplane fly further, but it will also fly straighter and more accurately. This will make it easier to fly the paper airplane and will allow you to have more fun with it. 

## How to Replicate the Results 

To replicate the results, you will need to follow the steps outlined in this paper. Gather the materials, fold the paper, and make the adjustments. Once you have done this, you should be able to replicate the results. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, this simple trick will make your paper airplane fly 200 feet. You won't believe what happens next! With this trick, you will be able to make a paper airplane that flies further and straighter than ever before. So, go ahead and give it a try!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make a paper airplane fly 200 feet?**

**A1:** The simple trick is to fold the paper airplane in a specific way that makes it more aerodynamic and able to fly longer distances. Additionally, adding a weight to the nose of the plane can help it fly further. 

**Q2: What kind of paper should I use for the plane?**

**A2:** You should use a lightweight paper, such as printer paper or origami paper, for the plane. Heavier papers can make the plane too heavy and cause it to fly shorter distances. 

**Q3: How do I add a weight to the plane?**

**A3:** You can add a weight to the plane by attaching a small object, such as a paperclip or a penny, to the nose of the plane. This will help the plane fly further and with more stability. 

**Q4: What other modifications can I make to the plane?**

**A4:** You can make other modifications to the plane, such as adding a tail or changing the shape of the wings, to make the plane fly further. Experimenting with different modifications can help you find the perfect combination for your plane. 

**Q5: Is there any way to make the plane fly faster?**

**A5:** Yes, you can make the plane fly faster by adding a weight to the tail of the plane. This will make the plane more aerodynamic and will help it fly faster.
