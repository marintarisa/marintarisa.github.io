Paper airplanes are a fun and easy way to explore the science of aerodynamics. But did you know that you can make your paper airplane fly faster than a real airplane? With just a few simple adjustments, you can make your paper airplane fly faster than ever before.

First, use a heavier paper. Heavier paper will help your plane fly faster and farther. You can also use a thicker paper, such as card stock. This will make the wings stiffer and more aerodynamic, allowing the plane to fly faster.

Second, create a longer wing. Longer wings provide more lift and stability, allowing the plane to fly faster. You can also add a tail to the plane, which will help increase stability and speed.

Finally, adjust the angle of the wings. The angle of the wings determines how much lift the plane will generate. If you make the wings more angled, the plane will be able to fly faster.

By following these simple tips, you can make your paper airplane fly faster than a real airplane. So, the next time you make a paper airplane, be sure to try these tricks and see how fast your plane can go!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1. What is this trick to make a paper airplane fly faster?**

**A1. This trick involves folding the wings of the paper airplane in a particular way that increases lift and reduces drag. This allows the paper airplane to fly faster than a real airplane.**

**Q2. What kind of paper should I use for this trick?**

**A2. You should use a lightweight paper such as copy paper or construction paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock or poster board will make the airplane too heavy to fly.**

**Q3. How do I fold the wings of the paper airplane?**

**A3. To fold the wings, start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then fold the wings up at a 45-degree angle from the center line of the paper. Finally, fold the wings down at a 45-degree angle from the center line of the paper.**

**Q4. How can I make sure the paper airplane flies straight?**

**A4. To make sure the paper airplane flies straight, ensure that the wings are symmetrical and that the nose is pointed in the same direction as the wings.**

**Q5. What other tips can I use to make my paper airplane fly faster?**

**A5. Other tips to make your paper airplane fly faster include adding a weight to the nose of the airplane and ensuring that the wings are not too thick. Additionally, make sure the paper is not too wrinkled as this can cause drag.**
