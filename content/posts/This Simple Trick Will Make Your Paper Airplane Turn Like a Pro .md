## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make a paper airplane that turns like a pro? Well, with this simple trick, you can make your paper airplane turn like an expert!

## Background Information

Paper airplanes have been around for centuries, with the earliest known paper airplane being traced back to Ancient China. It's no surprise that paper airplanes have been around for so long, as they are a great way to have fun, explore aerodynamics, and teach kids about science. 

## Purpose of the Paper

The purpose of this paper is to provide step-by-step instructions on how to make a professional-grade paper airplane that turns like a pro. With this simple trick, you'll be able to make a paper airplane that will turn and soar like a pro!

## Steps to Make a Professional-Grade Paper Airplane

### Gather Materials

To make a professional-grade paper airplane, you'll need a few materials: 

- 1 sheet of 8.5x11 inch paper
- Scissors
- Tape

### Fold the Plane

Once you have all the materials, it's time to start folding. First, fold the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again, but this time, width-wise. Now, fold the top corners of the paper down to the center. Finally, fold the paper in half one last time, and you're ready to go!

### Launch the Plane

Now that your paper airplane is all folded up, it's time to launch it. To launch your plane, hold it at the center and give it a good toss. With this simple trick, your paper airplane will turn like a pro!

## Conclusion

### Summary of the Steps 

To make a professional-grade paper airplane that turns like a pro, you'll need to gather materials, fold the paper, and launch the plane. 

### Benefits of Making a Professional-Grade Paper Airplane

Making a professional-grade paper airplane is a great way to have fun, explore aerodynamics, and teach kids about science. With this simple trick, you'll be able to make a paper airplane that will turn and soar like a pro!

If you have ever wanted to make a paper airplane that can turn like a pro, then this simple trick is for you! With just a few simple steps and a few materials, you can make a paper airplane that will turn like a pro. First, you will need to fold your paper in the traditional way for a paper airplane. Then, cut two small, triangular-shaped pieces of paper and attach them to the wings of your plane. This will help to create a more aerodynamic plane that will turn more easily. Finally, you will need to adjust the weight of the plane by adding small pieces of paper around the body of the plane. This will help to balance the plane and make it easier to turn. With these simple steps, you can make a paper airplane that will turn like a pro!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the main trick for making a paper airplane turn?**

**A1:** The main trick for making a paper airplane turn is to add a slight curve to the wings. This will cause the plane to turn in the direction of the curve when it is thrown.

**Q2: What type of paper should I use for my paper airplane?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use for a paper airplane is a lightweight, thin paper such as printer paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock will not fly as well.

**Q3: How do I curve the wings of the paper airplane?**

**A3:** To curve the wings of the paper airplane, fold the wings outward and then back in slightly. This will create a gentle curve that will cause the plane to turn when thrown.

**Q4: How do I throw the paper airplane to make it turn?**

**A4:** To make the paper airplane turn, throw it with a slight spin. This will cause the plane to turn in the direction of the curve on the wings.

**Q5: How can I make my paper airplane fly farther?**

**A5:** To make your paper airplane fly farther, make sure the wings are evenly balanced and the plane is thrown with a smooth, consistent motion. Also, try experimenting with different shapes and sizes of wings to find the best design for your plane.
