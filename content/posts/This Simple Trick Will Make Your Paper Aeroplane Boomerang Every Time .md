## Introduction
Paper aeroplanes are a classic childhood pastime. They are easy to make, require minimal supplies, and offer hours of fun. But did you know you can make your paper aeroplane boomerang? With this simple trick, you can make your paper aeroplane boomerang every time!

## Definition of a Paper Aeroplane
A paper aeroplane is a toy aircraft made out of paper or cardstock. The most common type is a glider, which is propelled by throwing it in the air. Paper aeroplanes are an easy and affordable way to have fun, as they require minimal supplies and are easy to make.

## Benefits of a Paper Aeroplane Boomerang
A paper aeroplane boomerang is a paper aeroplane that is designed to fly in a circular pattern and return to the thrower. This is a great way to have fun and challenge yourself, as it requires skill and practice to get the aeroplane to boomerang every time.

## Steps to Make Your Paper Aeroplane Boomerang Every Time
Making a paper aeroplane boomerang is easy and can be done in just a few simple steps.

### Step 1: Gather the Necessary Supplies
To make a paper aeroplane boomerang, you will need a piece of paper or cardstock, scissors, and tape.

### Step 2: Fold the Paper Into a Paper Aeroplane
Once you have gathered the necessary supplies, fold the paper into a paper aeroplane. This can be done by folding the paper in half lengthwise, then folding each side up to meet the center fold.

### Step 3: Adjust the Paper Aeroplane for Boomerang Effect
Once your paper aeroplane is folded, you can adjust it for the boomerang effect. To do this, you will need to cut two small slits in the back of the paper aeroplane. This will allow the air to flow through the slits, which will make the paper aeroplane boomerang.

## Conclusion
Making a paper aeroplane boomerang is a fun and easy way to have fun. With just a few simple steps and minimal supplies, you can make your paper aeroplane boomerang every time. All you need to do is gather the necessary supplies, fold the paper into a paper aeroplane, and adjust the paper aeroplane for the boomerang effect. With this simple trick, you can make your paper aeroplane boomerang every time!

Paper aeroplanes have been a source of entertainment for generations of children. But have you ever wished you could make your paper aeroplane fly back to you? Well, the good news is that it is possible! With this simple trick, you can make your paper aeroplane boomerang every time. All you need is a bit of knowledge and the right materials.

First, you need to make sure that your paper aeroplane is balanced. This means that the wings should be the same size and shape, and that the nose and tail should be the same length. Once you have achieved this, you can move on to the next step.

Next, you need to make sure that your paper aeroplane is aerodynamically sound. This means that it should have a smooth surface that minimizes drag. You can achieve this by folding the paper in a way that creates a curved surface. This will give your paper aeroplane the lift it needs to fly.

Finally, you need to add weight to the back of your paper aeroplane. You can do this by taping a penny or other small object to the back of the plane. This will give it the momentum it needs to fly back to you.

With these simple steps, you can make your paper aeroplane boomerang every time. This is a great way to have fun with friends and family and to show off your aeronautical skills. So, why not give it a try? With a bit of practice, you will soon be able to master the art of paper aeroplane boomeranging.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q: What is the simple trick for making a paper aeroplane boomerang?**

**A: The trick is to fold the wings of the paper aeroplane in a curved shape.**

**Q: What is the benefit of curving the wings?**

**A: Curving the wings creates an airfoil shape, which creates lift and helps the plane to fly further and come back to you.**

**Q: What kind of paper should be used to make the plane?**

**A: Any kind of paper can be used, but thinner paper will work best.**

**Q: How should the plane be thrown?**

**A: The plane should be thrown with a slight spin to help it fly further and come back to you.**

**Q: Are there any other tips for making the plane fly further?**

**A: You can also make the plane heavier by adding a small weight, such as a paperclip, to the nose of the plane. This will help it fly further and come back to you.**
