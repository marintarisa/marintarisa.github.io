## Preparation

Before you begin laying tiles, there are a few steps you need to take to ensure a successful installation.

## Steps to Laying Tiles

### Placing the Tiles

Once the adhesive has been applied, you can begin placing the tiles. Start at one corner of the area and work your way out. Use spacers to ensure the tiles are evenly spaced. 

### Cutting the Tiles

If necessary, you may need to cut some of the tiles to fit the area. Use a wet saw or tile nippers to cut the tiles. 

### Grouting the Tiles

Once the tiles are in place, you can grout them. Use a grout float to spread the grout evenly between the tiles. Make sure to wipe away any excess grout.
