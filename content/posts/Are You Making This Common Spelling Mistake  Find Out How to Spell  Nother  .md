## Introduction

Do you often find yourself unsure of how to spell certain words? If so, you’re not alone. One of the most common spelling mistakes is the word 'nother'. Many people spell it as 'an other' or 'anuther', but they are both incorrect. In this post, we’ll explain the correct spelling of 'nother' and provide some tips for avoiding this common mistake.

## Common Spelling Mistake

Many people mistakenly spell 'nother' as 'an other' or 'anuther'. This is because the word is often used in phrases such as 'one other' or 'another'. However, these phrases are actually two separate words, not one. 'Nother' is an informal contraction of 'no other', and therefore should be spelled as one word.

## Correct Spelling

The correct spelling of 'nother' is 'nother'. This is because 'nother' is an informal contraction of 'no other'. It is not two separate words.

Examples of the correct spelling:

- I can’t think of nother way to do it.
- There’s nother option left.
- She had nother choice.

## Tips for Avoiding the Mistake

If you’re still unsure of how to spell 'nother', here are a few tips to help you remember:

- Remember that 'nother' is an informal contraction of 'no other'.
- If you’re unsure, try writing out the phrase 'no other' and then contracting it to 'nother'.
- Use mnemonic devices such as rhymes to help you remember the correct spelling. For example, you could use the phrase 'no other, nother'.
