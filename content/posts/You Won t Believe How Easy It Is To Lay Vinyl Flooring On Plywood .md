Vinyl flooring is an ideal choice for any room in your home. It is highly durable and resistant to water damage, making it perfect for kitchens and bathrooms.

Additionally, vinyl flooring is available in a variety of styles, from classic wood-look planks to modern geometric designs.

## B. Overview of the Process

Laying vinyl flooring on plywood is a straightforward process. First, you'll need to prepare the plywood subfloor by cleaning it and applying adhesive and underlayment. Then, you'll need to cut the vinyl flooring to size and lay it in the corner of the room. Finally, you'll need to seal the edges of the vinyl flooring to ensure a secure fit.

## II. Preparing the Plywood Subfloor

Before you can lay the vinyl flooring, you'll need to prepare the plywood subfloor. This includes cleaning the subfloor to remove any dirt, dust, or debris, as well as applying adhesive and underlayment.

### A. Cleaning the Subfloor

The first step in preparing the plywood subfloor is to clean it. Use a vacuum to remove any dirt, dust, or debris. Then, use a damp cloth to wipe down the subfloor, making sure to remove any residue.

### A. Starting in the Corner

Start by laying the vinyl flooring in the corner of the room. Make sure the edges of the vinyl flooring are lined up with the walls.

### B. Laying the Vinyl

Once the corner is in place, you can begin laying the vinyl flooring. Start in the corner and work your way out to the edges of the room.

### C. Sealing the Edges

Once the vinyl flooring is laid, you'll need to seal the edges. Use a sealant to ensure a secure fit and prevent water damage.
