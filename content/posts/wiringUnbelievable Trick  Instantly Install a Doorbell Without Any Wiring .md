## Introduction to Installing a Doorbell Without Wiring

A doorbell is a device that is used to alert someone inside a building when someone is at the door. It typically consists of two parts: a button that is pressed to sound the bell, and a receiver that is mounted inside the building. The receiver will usually sound a chime or a buzzer to alert the occupants of the building. 

Having a doorbell can be very beneficial, as it allows people to know when someone is at the door without having to look out the window or open the door. It also provides an extra layer of security, as visitors can be identified before they are allowed to enter the building.
