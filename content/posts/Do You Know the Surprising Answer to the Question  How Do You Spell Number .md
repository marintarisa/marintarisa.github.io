## Introduction
Have you ever been asked the question, "How do you spell number?" and been unsure of the answer? You may be surprised to learn that the answer is not as straightforward as you might think. In this blog post, we'll explain the difference between numerals and numbers and how to spell each.

## Explanation of the Answer
When it comes to spelling out numbers, there are two types: numerals and numbers. Numerals are written symbols that represent numbers, such as the digits 0 through 9. Numbers, on the other hand, are written out as words, such as "one," "two," "three," and so on.

When it comes to spelling numerals, the answer is simple: just spell out the digits. For example, the numeral "7" is spelled "seven." 

When it comes to spelling numbers, the answer is a bit more complicated. Numbers are usually spelled out as words, but there are some exceptions. For example, the number "7" is usually spelled out as "seven," but it can also be written as "VII." 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the answer to the question, "How do you spell number?" depends on whether you are referring to numerals or numbers. Numerals are written symbols and should be spelled out as digits, while numbers are usually spelled out as words, but can also be written as numerals in some cases. Knowing the difference between numerals and numbers can help you spell numbers correctly.
