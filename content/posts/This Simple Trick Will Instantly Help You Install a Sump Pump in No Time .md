## What is a Sump Pump?
A sump pump is a device used to pump water away from a basement or crawl space. It is typically installed in a sump pit, which is a hole dug in the floor of the basement or crawl space. The sump pump works by pumping the water from the sump pit to the outside of the house, where it can be safely disposed of.
