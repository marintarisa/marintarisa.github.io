# You Won't Believe What Happens When You Make This Paper Plane That Does Tricks!

Have you ever wanted to make a paper plane that can do tricks? If so, you’re in luck! This article will provide an overview of paper plane tricks, the benefits of making a plane that does tricks, and a step-by-step guide on how to make the plane.

## Overview of Paper Plane Tricks

Paper plane tricks are a fun way to entertain yourself and your friends. With a paper plane that does tricks, you can perform stunts like loops, dives, and barrel rolls. You can also make the plane spin and soar through the sky with ease. 

## Benefits of Making a Plane That Does Tricks

Making a paper plane that does tricks is a great way to practice your origami skills and improve your hand-eye coordination. It’s also a fun way to pass the time and show off your creativity. Plus, it’s an inexpensive hobby that requires minimal materials. 

## How to Make the Plane

Making a paper plane that does tricks is relatively simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to make the plane: 

### Gather Necessary Materials

First, you’ll need to gather the necessary materials. You’ll need a piece of paper, scissors, tape, and any other materials you want to use to customize the plane. 

### Fold the Paper in the Correct Way

Next, you’ll need to fold the paper in the correct way. This will ensure that the plane is able to perform tricks. There are many different folding techniques, so you can experiment with different ones to find the one that works best for you. 

### Add Features to the Plane for Trick-Performing

Finally, you can add features to the plane to make it more aerodynamic and better suited for trick-performing. For example, you can add a tail to the plane or adjust the wings to make them more curved. 

## Performing Tricks with the Plane

Once you’ve made the plane, you can start performing tricks with it. Here are some different tricks that you can try: 

### Different Tricks That Can Be Performed

- Loops: You can make the plane loop in the air by throwing it with a circular motion. 
- Dives: You can make the plane dive by throwing it with a downward motion. 
- Barrel Rolls: You can make the plane do barrel rolls by throwing it with a side-to-side motion. 

### Tips for Performing Tricks Successfully

To ensure that your tricks are successful, you should practice throwing the plane with the correct motion. You should also make sure that the plane is balanced and aerodynamic. 

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

When performing tricks with the plane, it’s important to avoid common mistakes. These include throwing the plane with too much force, throwing it with the wrong motion, and not making sure that the plane is balanced. 

Making a paper plane that does tricks is a fun and rewarding activity. With this step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to make a plane that can perform tricks with ease. So why not give it a try?
