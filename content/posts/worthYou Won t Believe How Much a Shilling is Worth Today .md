If you’ve ever heard of a shilling, you probably know it’s an old form of currency. But did you know that a shilling is still worth something today? It may surprise you to learn that a shilling is worth more than you think – and it’s all due to the power of intent.

Intent is the power of believing in something and having the will to make it happen. It’s a powerful force that can make things happen, even when it comes to money. In the case of shillings, intent has kept their value alive.

Today, a shilling is worth around £1.50. That’s a far cry from its original value, which was 12 pence. This significant increase in value is thanks to the power of intent. People who have held onto their shillings over the years have done so out of a belief that it will one day be worth something. This belief has kept the value of shillings alive and allowed them to appreciate in value over time.

The power of intent is an incredible thing. It’s a reminder that if you believe in something and have the will to make it happen, anything is possible. So, the next time you hear about a shilling, remember that it’s worth more than you think – all thanks to the power of intent.
