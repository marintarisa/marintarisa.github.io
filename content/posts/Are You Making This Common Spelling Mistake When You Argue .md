##Are You Making This Common Spelling Mistake When You Argue?

Arguments can get heated, and it can be easy to let your emotions get the better of you. But one mistake that can make your argument look unprofessional is making a spelling mistake. Whether you’re arguing with a friend or writing an essay for school, it’s important to make sure that your writing is free of spelling errors.

###I. Introduction 
A common spelling mistake is when you mix up homophones or omit apostrophes. Homophones are words that sound the same, but have different meanings and spellings. Examples of homophones are “their” and “there”, and “your” and “you’re”. Omitting apostrophes can also lead to confusion and make your argument look sloppy. 

###II. Common Spelling Mistake in Arguments 
Misusing homophones is a common mistake when you’re arguing. For example, if you write “your wrong” instead of “you’re wrong”, it can make your argument look less credible. Omitting apostrophes is also a common mistake. For example, if you write “its” instead of “it’s”, it can make your argument look sloppy. 

###III. How to Avoid Making This Mistake 
To avoid making this mistake, it’s important to proofread and edit your writing before you submit it. Spell check can also be helpful, but it’s not foolproof. If you’re still unsure, you can always ask a friend or professional to help you proofread your work. 

###IV. Conclusion 
In conclusion, it’s important to avoid making common spelling mistakes when you’re arguing. Misusing homophones and omitting apostrophes can make your argument look sloppy and unprofessional. To avoid making this mistake, it’s important to proofread and edit your writing, use spell check, and ask for help from a friend or professional.
