## Introduction to Android Development on Ubuntu

Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems in the world. It has an extensive library of applications, games, and tools that can be used to create powerful and engaging mobile experiences. For developers, Android provides an incredibly powerful platform to build and deploy applications. With the right tools, you can create amazing apps that can be used by millions of people around the world. 

If you’re a developer looking to get started with Android development, one of the best tools you can use is Android Studio. Android Studio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy to create, test, and deploy Android apps. In this blog post, we’ll look at how to install Android Studio on Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution. 

## Pre-Installation Steps

Before you can install Android Studio on Ubuntu, there are a few steps you’ll need to take. First, you’ll need to make sure your system meets the minimum requirements for running Android Studio. These include:

Once you’ve installed the JDK, you’ll need to set up the environment variables. This will allow the Android Studio installer to find the JDK. To do this, open the terminal and enter the following commands: 

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```
