## Introduction

Paper planes have been around since ancient times. They are a fun and easy way to entertain yourself and others. But what if you could make your paper plane fly further than ever before? Well, you can! With this simple trick, you can make your paper plane soar higher and farther than ever before. 

## Background Information

Paper planes are a great way to have fun and explore the principles of aerodynamics. They can be made from a variety of materials and be designed in a variety of shapes. The key to making a paper plane fly further is to design it in such a way that it has the right balance of lift and drag. 

## Purpose of the Trick

The purpose of this trick is to help you make your paper plane fly further than ever before. By following the steps outlined below, you can make your paper plane fly farther and higher than ever before. 

## Steps of the Trick

### Step 1

The first step is to find a piece of paper that is the right size and shape for your paper plane. You want to make sure that the paper is stiff enough to hold its shape, but not too stiff that it won't fly. 

### Step 2

The second step is to fold the paper in half lengthwise. This will create a crease that will help your paper plane hold its shape. Once you have folded the paper in half, unfold it and then fold it in half again the other way. This will create a cross shape. 

### Step 3

The third step is to fold the paper in half again lengthwise and then unfold it. This will create four creases in the paper. Now, fold the paper in half widthwise and then unfold it. This will create eight creases in the paper. Finally, fold the paper in half one last time lengthwise and then unfold it. This will create sixteen creases in the paper. 

## Conclusion

### Summary of the Trick

In summary, this simple trick will help you make your paper plane fly further than ever before. By following the steps outlined above, you can make your paper plane fly farther and higher than ever before. 

### Benefits of the Trick

The benefits of this trick are that it is simple and easy to do. It doesn't require any special tools or materials and can be done with just a piece of paper. Plus, it can help you make your paper plane fly further than ever before. So, give it a try and see how far your paper plane can go!

Paper planes are a fun and easy way to pass the time and make something creative. But if you want to take your paper plane experience to the next level, then this simple trick is for you! By adding a small piece of tape to the nose of the plane, you can make it fly further than ever before. This trick works because the tape adds weight to the nose of the plane, which helps it cut through the air more efficiently. Additionally, the tape also adds a bit of drag, which helps to slow the plane down, allowing it to coast further before it comes to a stop. So next time you're looking to have a paper plane competition, be sure to try this simple trick and watch your plane soar!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make paper planes fly further?**

**A1:** The simple trick to make paper planes fly further is to fold the wings of the plane at an angle. This angled fold creates more lift and helps the plane fly further. 

**Q2: How do I create an angled fold for my paper plane?**

**A2:** To create an angled fold for your paper plane, start by folding the wings of the plane in half lengthwise. Then, fold the wings up at an angle, so that the top of the wings are at a higher angle than the bottom. This angled fold will help the plane fly further. 

**Q3: What type of paper should I use to make my paper plane?**

**A3:** The type of paper you use to make your paper plane can have a big impact on how well it flies. For best results, use a heavier paper such as copy paper or cardstock. 

**Q4: What other modifications can I make to my paper plane to make it fly further?**

**A4:** Other modifications you can make to your paper plane to help it fly further include adding weight to the nose of the plane, adding a tail to the back of the plane, and adjusting the angle of the wings. 

**Q5: Are there any other tips I should keep in mind when making my paper plane?**

**A5:** Yes, there are a few other tips to keep in mind when making your paper plane. Make sure the wings are symmetrical and the edges are sharp. Also, make sure the plane is balanced and there is no extra weight on one side. Finally, make sure the nose of the plane is pointed and not rounded.
