In this blog post, we'll explain what a shower pan is, the benefits of building one on a plywood floor, and the steps you need to take to make it happen. 

## What is a Shower Pan? 

A shower pan is a waterproof barrier that is placed in the shower to prevent water from leaking out. It is typically made of a plastic or rubber material and is installed beneath the shower floor. It is important to have a shower pan in order to ensure that the shower is safe and watertight. 

## Benefits of Building a Shower Pan on a Plywood Floor 

There are many benefits to building a shower pan on a plywood floor. First, it is much less expensive than installing a pre-made shower pan. Additionally, it is easier to customize the shape and size of the shower pan to fit the space. Finally, it is much easier to repair and replace a shower pan that is built on a plywood floor. 

## Steps to Building a Shower Pan on a Plywood Floor 

Now that you know the benefits of building a shower pan on a plywood floor, let's take a look at the steps you need to take to make it happen. 

### Preparing the Plywood Floor 

The first step is to prepare the plywood floor. Start by sanding down any rough spots and removing any nails or screws. Then, apply a sealant to the plywood to make it waterproof. 

### Installing the Shower Liner 

The next step is to install the shower liner. This is a plastic or rubber material that is placed over the plywood floor. Make sure to cut the liner to the correct size and use a sealant to make it waterproof. 

### Installing the Shower Drain 

Once the shower liner is in place, you can install the shower drain. This is a metal or plastic drain that is placed in the center of the shower pan and is used to collect and drain away the water. 

### Installing the Shower Curb 

The last step is to install the shower curb. This is a piece of wood or metal that is placed around the perimeter of the shower pan to prevent water from leaking out.
