### Definition of a Paper Airplane

A paper airplane is a toy aircraft made from a single sheet of paper that is folded and launched into the air. The goal of making a paper airplane is to make it fly as far and as accurately as possible. 

### Benefits of Making a Paper Airplane

Making a paper airplane is a great way to teach children about aerodynamics, as well as the principles of physics. It can also help improve hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills. Plus, it's a great way to spend quality time with your family and friends.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Gather Materials

The materials you will need to make a paper airplane are a sheet of printer paper, scissors, tape, and a pencil. 

### Fold the Paper

Once you have all the materials, you can start to fold the paper. Begin by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again, but this time widthwise. This will create four equal sections. 

### Create the Wings

Next, fold the top two corners down to meet the center line. This will create the wings of the paper airplane. 

### Add the Tail

Now, fold the bottom corner up to meet the center line. This will create the tail of the paper airplane. 

### Test the Paper Airplane

Finally, you can test your paper airplane by launching it into the air. Make sure to adjust the wings and tail as needed to get the best flight.
