## Introduction 

Do you remember the days when you were a kid, folding paper airplanes and then launching them off into the sky? It was so much fun, and it felt like you could fly so far! Well, you can fly even farther now with this simple trick to folding the perfect paper airplane. 

## Background Information 

Paper airplanes have been around for centuries. In fact, the earliest known paper airplane was made in 1848 by British scientist Sir George Cayley. He used it to demonstrate the principles of aerodynamics. Since then, paper airplanes have become a popular pastime for children and adults alike.

## Purpose of the Outline 

This outline will explain how to fold the perfect paper airplane, as well as the benefits of flying it. 

## Steps for Folding the Perfect Paper Airplane

### Step 1: Gather Materials 

The first step is to gather the materials you need. All you need is a piece of paper, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. 

### Step 2: Fold the Wings 

Fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the wings. To do this, start at the top of the paper and fold each side down to the center crease. 

### Step 3: Attach the Tail 

Attach the tail by folding the bottom of the paper up to the center crease. 

### Step 4: Launch the Plane 

Now it's time to launch the plane! Hold the paper plane at the center and launch it with a flick of the wrist. 

## Benefits of Flying the Perfect Paper Airplane 

There are many benefits to flying the perfect paper airplane. 

### Increased Distance 

The perfect paper airplane will fly farther than an ordinary paper airplane. This is because it is more aerodynamic, which means it can glide through the air more efficiently. 

### Improved Accuracy 

The perfect paper airplane is more accurate than an ordinary paper airplane. This means that you can aim it more precisely and it will fly in the direction you want it to go. 

### Increased Fun 

Flying the perfect paper airplane is more fun because it flies farther and more accurately. This means that you can have more fun launching it and watching it soar through the sky. 

## Conclusion 

Folding the perfect paper airplane is a great way to have fun and explore the principles of aerodynamics. With this simple trick, you can fly farther and more accurately than ever before. So, why not give it a try?
