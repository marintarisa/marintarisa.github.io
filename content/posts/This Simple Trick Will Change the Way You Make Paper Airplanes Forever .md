## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is this simple trick?**

**A1:** This simple trick is a new way to fold a paper airplane that ensures a longer, more stable flight. 

**Q2: How does this trick work?**

**A2:** This trick works by folding the paper in a specific way that creates a more aerodynamic shape for the plane to fly. The trick also adds stability to the plane, which helps it fly farther and more accurately.

**Q3: What kind of paper is best for making paper airplanes?**

**A3:** The best kind of paper for making paper airplanes is thin, lightweight paper such as printer paper or construction paper. Heavier paper, such as cardstock, is more difficult to fold and will not fly as well. 

**Q4: What other materials can be used to make paper airplanes?**

**A4:** You can also use foil, wax paper, or even plastic wrap to make paper airplanes. These materials are lightweight and will fly better than heavier materials. 

**Q5: Are there any other tips for making paper airplanes?**

**A5:** Yes! Make sure to use a ruler and a sharp crease when folding the paper, and be sure to keep the folds as tight as possible. Also, adding a paper clip to the nose of the plane can help to add stability and make it fly farther.
