Making a paper airplane is a fun and easy activity that requires just a few simple materials. With a few folds and a few pieces of lined paper, you can make an awesome paper airplane that will fly farther and faster than ever before. With this simple trick, you can make the perfect paper airplane with ease.

First, start with a piece of lined paper. This will help you keep your folds even and in line. Fold the paper in half lengthwise and then unfold. Then, fold the paper in half widthwise and unfold. You should now have 4 creases in the paper. Next, fold the paper in half diagonally and unfold. Finally, fold the top two corners to the center crease and unfold.

Now, with the paper still in the same position, fold the top two corners down to the bottom two corners. Then, fold the top of the paper down to the bottom. Finally, fold the wings down and tuck them in.

The result is an awesome paper airplane that will fly farther and faster than ever before. With this simple trick, you can make the perfect paper airplane with ease. So, the next time you want to make a paper airplane, remember this simple trick and you will be able to make the perfect paper airplane every time.
