# Introduction 
Are you looking to upgrade your flooring but don’t know where to start? Installing subfloor is a great option for any DIYer looking to add a layer of protection and insulation to their flooring. In this article, we’ll take a look at what subfloor is, the benefits of installing it, and the steps to install it. 

## Definition of Subfloor
Subfloor is a layer of material that is installed beneath the finish flooring. It serves as a base for the flooring and provides support, insulation, and protection from moisture. It is typically made of plywood or OSB (oriented strand board). 

## Benefits of Installing Subfloor
Installing subfloor has many benefits. It provides a solid base for the flooring, increases the lifespan of the flooring, and helps to insulate the space. It also helps to reduce noise from foot traffic and provides a moisture barrier. 

# Steps to Install Subfloor
Installing subfloor is a relatively simple process. Here are the steps to get started: 

## Preparing the Area
Before you begin, make sure the area is clean and free of debris. Remove any existing flooring, such as carpet or tile, and inspect the subfloor for any signs of damage. 

## Laying the Subfloor
Once the area is prepared, you can begin to lay the subfloor. Start with the first sheet of plywood or OSB and use a power saw to cut it to size. Make sure the edges are flush and the sheet is level. Secure the sheet to the floor joists using screws. 

## Securing the Subfloor
Once the first sheet is in place, lay the remaining sheets and secure them to the joists. Use a level to make sure the sheets are even and the edges are flush. Once all the sheets are in place, use a power saw to cut the edges to size.
