## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
## Q1: What is the best type of paper to use for a paper airplane?

**A1:** The best type of paper to use for a paper airplane is a lightweight paper with a smooth surface, such as a sheet of printer paper or a sheet of construction paper. 

## Q2: How do you make a paper airplane?

**A2:** To make a paper airplane, start by folding a sheet of paper in half lengthwise. Then, unfold the paper and fold the top 2 corners down to the center crease. Next, fold the top of the paper down to the bottom edge and fold the wings down. Finally, fold the plane in half and make a few small adjustments to the wings to give the plane stability.

## Q3: How do you make a paper airplane fly farther?

**A3:** To make a paper airplane fly farther, make sure the wings are even and symmetrical. You can also adjust the angle of the wings to make the plane fly farther. Additionally, adding a paper clip to the nose can help the plane fly farther.

## Q4: What is the best way to launch a paper airplane?

**A4:** The best way to launch a paper airplane is to hold it with the nose pointing up and give it a gentle toss. You should also make sure that you launch the plane at a slight angle, rather than straight up.

## Q5: How can I make the paper airplane more aerodynamic?

**A5:** To make the paper airplane more aerodynamic, make sure the wings are even and symmetrical. You can also adjust the angle of the wings to make the plane fly farther. Additionally, adding a paper clip to the nose can help the plane fly farther. Additionally, you can make small adjustments to the wings to reduce drag and make the plane more aerodynamic.
