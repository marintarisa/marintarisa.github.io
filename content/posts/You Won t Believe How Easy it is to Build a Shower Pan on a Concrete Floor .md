Are you considering building a shower pan on a concrete floor? If so, you're in luck! This project is actually quite simple and can be completed in a few easy steps. In this blog post, we'll discuss what a shower pan is and the benefits of building one on a concrete floor. We'll then go over the steps you need to take to build a shower pan on a concrete floor. Let's get started!

## Definition of a Shower Pan

A shower pan is a waterproof base that is installed in the bottom of a shower. It is designed to keep water from leaking onto the floor and damaging the surrounding area. It is typically made of plastic, fiberglass, or concrete and is installed before the shower walls and fixtures are added.

## Benefits of Building a Shower Pan on a Concrete Floor

Building a shower pan on a concrete floor has several advantages. First, it is a relatively simple project that can be completed in a few hours. Second, it is a cost-effective solution as it does not require any special tools or materials. Finally, it is a great way to ensure that your shower is properly waterproofed and will last for many years.

## Steps to Building a Shower Pan on a Concrete Floor

Now that you know what a shower pan is and the benefits of building one on a concrete floor, let's go over the steps you need to take to build a shower pan on a concrete floor.

### Prepare the Area

The first step is to prepare the area where the shower pan will be installed. This includes removing any existing flooring, cleaning the area, and making sure the floor is level.

### Install the Pre-Slope

The next step is to install the pre-slope. This is a layer of material that is installed before the shower liner. It helps ensure that water is directed towards the drain.

### Install the Shower Liner

Once the pre-slope is installed, the shower liner can be added. This is a waterproof membrane that helps keep water from seeping through the floor.

### Install the Drain

The next step is to install the drain. This is the part of the shower pan that allows water to flow away from the shower.

### Install the Shower Curb

Finally, the shower curb can be installed. This is a raised edge that helps keep water contained in the shower.

## Conclusion

Building a shower pan on a concrete floor is a relatively simple project that can be completed in a few hours. It is a cost-effective solution as it does not require any special tools or materials. Plus, it is a great way to ensure that your shower is properly waterproofed and will last for many years.
