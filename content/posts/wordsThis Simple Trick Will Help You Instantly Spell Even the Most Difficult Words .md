Having trouble spelling a difficult word? You're not alone! Many people struggle with spelling, particularly when it comes to longer, more complicated words. Fortunately, there is a simple trick you can use to instantly spell even the most difficult words. All you need is a dictionary and a few intent words to help you. 

First, start by breaking the word down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you identify the root words and any prefixes or suffixes that may be attached. Once you have identified the root words, use a dictionary to look up each one individually. This will give you a better understanding of the meaning of the word and help you remember how to spell it. 

Next, use intent words to help you remember the spelling. For example, if you are trying to spell the word "antidisestablishmentarianism", you could use the intent words "anti" (against), "dis" (not), "establish" (set up) and "arian" (relating to). Repeating these intent words in order can help you remember the correct spelling. 

Finally, practice spelling the word aloud. This will help you to commit the spelling to memory and make it easier to remember in the future. 

By breaking down difficult words, using intent words to help you remember the spelling and practicing aloud, you can easily master even the most challenging words. Give it a try and see how quickly you can become a spelling whiz!
