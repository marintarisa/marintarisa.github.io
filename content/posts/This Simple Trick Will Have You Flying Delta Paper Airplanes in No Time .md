## Definition of a Delta Paper Airplane

A delta paper airplane is a type of paper airplane that is designed to fly long distances. It is characterized by its triangular shape and long wings. The wingspan of a delta paper airplane is usually larger than that of a traditional paper airplane. This allows the plane to fly farther and stay in the air longer. 

## Benefits of Flying Delta Paper Airplanes

There are many benefits to flying delta paper airplanes. First, they are easy to make and require minimal supplies. All you need is a sheet of paper, scissors, and tape. Second, they are safe and fun to fly. Delta paper airplanes can be used indoors and outdoors, and they are safe for kids of all ages. Finally, they are great for teaching children about aerodynamics. As the plane flies, kids can observe how the wings and tail affect the flight path. 

## Steps to Making a Delta Paper Airplane

Now that you know the benefits of flying delta paper airplanes, let’s get started on making one. Here are the steps: 

### Gather Supplies

The first step is to gather the supplies you need. You will need a single sheet of paper, scissors, and tape. 

### Create a Template

Next, you will need to create a template for your delta paper airplane. You can use a ruler to draw a triangle on the paper. The triangle should measure 8 inches on each side. 

### Fold the Paper

Once you have your template, it’s time to fold the paper. Begin by folding the triangle in half. Then, fold the wings up so that they are perpendicular to the body of the plane. Finally, fold the tail down so that it is flush with the bottom of the plane. 

### Test the Airplane

Now that your plane is ready, it’s time to test it out. Take your plane to an open area and throw it. Observe how the plane flies and make adjustments as needed. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, delta paper airplanes are an easy and fun way to get your feet off the ground. They are easy to make, require minimal supplies, and are safe for kids of all ages. To make a delta paper airplane, you will need a sheet of paper, scissors, and tape. Then, you will need to create a template, fold the paper, and test the airplane. So, what are you waiting for?
