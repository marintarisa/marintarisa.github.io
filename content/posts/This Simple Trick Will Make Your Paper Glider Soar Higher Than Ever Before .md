## Introduction 

Paper gliders are a fun and easy way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. They can be made with just a few simple materials, and they can be flown indoors or outdoors. In this post, we will share a simple trick that will make your paper glider soar higher than ever before! 

## Background Information on Paper Gliders

Paper gliders are a type of model aircraft that are made from paper or cardstock. The wings are usually constructed from two pieces of paper or cardstock that are folded into a V-shape. The tail is usually constructed from a single piece of paper or cardstock. The glider is then launched by throwing it in an upward trajectory. 

## Purpose of the Trick

The purpose of this trick is to make your paper glider fly higher and farther than it normally would. This is accomplished by adding weight to the glider and adjusting the angle of attack. 

## How to Make the Paper Glider Soar Higher

### Step 1: Create the Glider

The first step is to create the glider. To do this, you will need two pieces of paper or cardstock, scissors, and tape. Start by folding one of the pieces of paper or cardstock in half lengthwise. Then, fold the other piece of paper or cardstock in half widthwise. Next, cut a V-shape in the center of each piece of paper or cardstock. Finally, tape the two pieces together to form the wings and tail of the glider. 

### Step 2: Add Weight to the Glider

The next step is to add weight to the glider. This can be done by taping a penny or paperclip to the nose of the glider. This will increase the weight of the glider and make it fly farther and higher. 

### Step 3: Adjust the Angle of Attack

The final step is to adjust the angle of attack. This is done by slightly tilting the wings of the glider upwards. This will cause the glider to fly in an upward trajectory, allowing it to fly higher and farther than it normally would. 

## Conclusion

This simple trick will make your paper glider soar higher than ever before! The added weight and adjusted angle of attack will increase the glider’s lift, allowing it to fly farther and higher. In addition, this trick is easy to do and requires only a few simple materials. So, give it a try and see how high your paper glider can go!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is a paper glider?**

**A1:** A paper glider is a toy aircraft that is made of paper or other light material and is designed to fly through the air by using the principles of aerodynamics. 

**Q2: How can I make my paper glider soar higher?**

**A2:** To make your paper glider soar higher, you can use a technique called “wing warping” which involves adjusting the shape of the wings to create more lift. This can be done by gently bending the wings in different directions.

**Q3: What other materials can I use to make a paper glider?**

**A3:** You can use other light materials such as balsa wood or foam to make a paper glider. However, paper is the most common material used for this type of aircraft.

**Q4: What other techniques can I use to make my paper glider soar higher?**

**A4:** You can also adjust the angle of attack, which is the angle of the wings relative to the airflow. This can be done by gently bending the wings up or down to create more lift. Additionally, you can add weight to the nose of the glider to shift the center of gravity and increase the glider's stability.

**Q5: How can I make my paper glider more aerodynamic?**

**A5:** You can make your paper glider more aerodynamic by shaping the wings and tail to reduce drag. Additionally, you can add small airfoils to the wings to increase lift.
