## Introduction
Paper airplanes are a classic pastime that nearly everyone has tried at least once. The basic concept is simple: fold a piece of paper into an aerodynamic shape, and then launch it to see how far it can fly. But what if there was a simple trick that could make your paper airplane fly farther than you ever thought possible? Well, there is! 

## Step-by-Step Instructions
To make your paper airplane fly farther, you'll need a few simple supplies: a piece of paper, scissors, and a ruler. First, fold your paper in half lengthwise. Then, cut two slits in the top of the paper, each about one inch long. Next, fold the top of the paper down so that the slits are facing out. Finally, fold the wings of the paper airplane up, so that they are at a slight angle.

Now it's time to launch your paper airplane! The key to making it fly farther is to launch it at an angle. To do this, hold the paper airplane at an angle above your head, and then throw it forward. As it flies, the slits in the top of the paper will catch the air and help the paper airplane fly farther and faster.

## Conclusion
Using this simple trick can make your paper airplane fly farther than you ever thought possible! Not only is it a fun activity for all ages, but it also helps to teach the basics of aerodynamics. So the next time you make a paper airplane, give this trick a try and see how far it can fly!
