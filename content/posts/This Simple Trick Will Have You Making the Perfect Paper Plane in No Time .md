## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the key to making the perfect paper plane?**

**A1:** The key to making the perfect paper plane is to use the right folding technique. By following the instructions carefully and making crisp, clean folds, you can ensure that your paper plane will fly straight and far.

**Q2: What materials do I need to make a paper plane?**

**A2:** You will need a piece of paper, scissors (optional) and a ruler (optional). You can also use a pen or pencil to make marks on the paper.

**Q3: How big should the paper be for a paper plane?**

**A3:** The size of the paper does not matter too much, as long as it is not too small or too large. A standard size piece of A4 paper is usually the best size to use.

**Q4: What is the best folding technique to use?**

**A4:** The best folding technique to use is the classic “accordion fold”. This involves folding the paper in half lengthwise, then folding the paper in half again, and repeating this process until the paper is the desired size.

**Q5: How do I make my paper plane fly farther?**

**A5:** To make your paper plane fly farther, you should make sure that the folds are crisp and clean, and that the wings are even. You can also adjust the angle of the wings to make the plane fly farther.
