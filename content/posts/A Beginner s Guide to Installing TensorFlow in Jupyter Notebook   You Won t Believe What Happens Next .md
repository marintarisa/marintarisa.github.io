# Introduction to Installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook

Installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook can be a daunting task for beginners. However, with the right guidance, you can easily install TensorFlow and get started with machine learning. In this article, we will walk you through the steps of installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook.

## What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning. It was developed by Google and is used for numerical computation and deep learning. It is one of the most popular machine learning frameworks in the world.

## What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is a great tool for data science and machine learning.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook, there are some prerequisites that need to be met. 

### System Requirements

The system requirements for installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook are: 

- Python 3.5 or higher
- Anaconda
- TensorFlow

### Installing Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R. It is used for data science and machine learning. To install Anaconda, download the latest version from the Anaconda website and follow the instructions.

## Installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook

Once you have installed Anaconda, you can start installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook. 

### Creating a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a tool that helps keep your projects isolated from each other. To create a virtual environment, open the Anaconda Navigator and select the Environments tab. Then click the Create button and enter the name of the virtual environment.

### Installing TensorFlow

Once the virtual environment is created, you can install TensorFlow in it. To do this, open the Anaconda Prompt and activate the virtual environment. Then type the command “pip install tensorflow” and press enter. 

### Activating the Virtual Environment

Once TensorFlow is installed, you need to activate the virtual environment. To do this, open the Anaconda Navigator and select the Environments tab. Then select the virtual environment and click the Activate button.

### Running TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can start running TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook. To do this, open the Jupyter Notebook and type the command “import tensorflow as tf”. Then type “tf.test.is_gpu_available()” to test if TensorFlow is running correctly. 

## Conclusion

Installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook can be a daunting task for beginners. However, with the right guidance, you can easily install TensorFlow and get started with machine learning. In this article, we have walked you through the steps of installing TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebook.
