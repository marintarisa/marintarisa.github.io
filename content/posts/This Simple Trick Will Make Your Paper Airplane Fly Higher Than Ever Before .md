## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to making a paper airplane fly higher?**

**A1:** The trick to making a paper airplane fly higher is to add a paper clip to the nose of the plane. This will add weight and help the plane fly higher and further.

**Q2: What kind of paper should I use to make a paper airplane?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use for making a paper airplane is a thin, lightweight paper such as copy paper or construction paper. Heavier paper may make the plane too heavy to fly.

**Q3: How do I add a paper clip to the nose of the plane?**

**A3:** To add a paper clip to the nose of the plane, fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the two ends together to form a triangle. Place the paper clip in the center of the triangle and then fold the ends of the triangle together to secure the paper clip.

**Q4: How do I make sure the paper clip doesn't come off during flight?**

**A4:** To ensure that the paper clip doesn't come off during flight, use tape to secure it to the nose of the plane. This will ensure that the paper clip stays in place during the flight.

**Q5: How much of an increase in flight distance can I expect from using this trick?**

**A5:** Depending on the type of paper used and the size of the paper clip, the addition of the paper clip can result in a significant increase in flight distance. On average, you can expect to see an increase of at least 10-20%.
