## What is a Paper Airplane?

A paper airplane is a type of model aircraft that is made out of paper or cardboard. It is usually constructed by folding a flat sheet of paper or cardboard into a variety of shapes and sizes. The paper airplane is then launched into the air, usually with a flick of the wrist.

## Overview of the Trick

This trick is a simple, step-by-step guide that will help you make the perfect paper airplane. We'll show you what materials you need, give you instructions on how to make the plane, and offer some helpful tips. With this trick, you'll have a paper airplane that soars through the air in no time!

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Materials Needed

To make your paper airplane, you'll need: 
- One sheet of 8.5x11 inch paper 
- Scissors 
- Tape (optional)

### Instructions

1. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise.
2. Unfold the paper and fold each side in so they meet in the middle.
3. Fold the top and bottom edges of the paper in to meet in the middle.
4. Fold the paper in half lengthwise again.
5. Fold each side up to make the wings.
6. Tape the wings together if desired.
7. Your paper airplane is now ready to fly!

### Tips

- Make sure to fold the paper as precisely as possible for the best results.
- Experiment with different shapes and sizes of wings to see which type of plane flies the best.
- Try using different types of paper or cardboard for different results.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the one trick to building perfect paper airplanes?**

**A1:** The one trick to building perfect paper airplanes is to use a template. Templates provide a clear, easy-to-follow guide for folding and constructing the airplane. This makes it much easier to get the shape and design of the airplane just right.

**Q2: What type of paper is best for making paper airplanes?**

**A2:** The best type of paper for making paper airplanes is lightweight, thin paper. This type of paper is easier to fold and will give the airplane a better shape. Heavyweight paper or cardstock can also be used, but it will be more difficult to fold and the airplane may not fly as well.

**Q3: What type of template should I use for making paper airplanes?**

**A3:** There are a variety of templates available online or in stores. You can purchase a template that is specifically designed for paper airplanes, or you can use a template from a book or magazine. It is important to make sure the template you use is the correct size and shape for the type of paper airplane you are making.

**Q4: How do I fold the paper to make a paper airplane?**

**A4:** To fold the paper to make a paper airplane, first you need to find the center of the paper. Then, fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold it in half again widthwise. Next, fold the top two corners down to meet in the center. Finally, fold the bottom two corners up to meet in the center. This will create the basic shape of the paper airplane.

**Q5: What is the best way to make the paper airplane fly?**

**A5:** The best way to make the paper airplane fly is to launch it with a gentle flick of the wrist. This will give the airplane enough momentum to stay airborne. It is also important to make sure that the airplane is balanced before launching it. Make small adjustments to the shape and weight of the airplane until it flies in a straight line.
