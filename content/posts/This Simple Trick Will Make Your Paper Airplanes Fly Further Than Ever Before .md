## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is this simple trick to make paper airplanes fly further?**

**A1:** This simple trick involves folding the wings of the paper airplane in an "X" shape, which helps to create more lift and makes the plane fly further. 

**Q2: What type of paper should I use for my paper airplane?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use for paper airplanes is lightweight paper such as printer paper, construction paper, or tissue paper. Avoid using thick paper such as cardstock as it will make the plane too heavy and it won’t fly as far. 

**Q3: How do I fold the wings of my paper airplane in an "X" shape?**

**A3:** To fold the wings of your paper airplane in an "X" shape, first fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the wings up so that they meet in the middle. Then, fold the wings down so that they meet in the middle again. Finally, fold the wings in half so that they form an "X" shape. 

**Q4: What are some other tips to make my paper airplane fly further?**

**A4:** Some other tips to make your paper airplane fly further include making sure the wings are symmetrical, making sure the nose of the plane is pointed, and ensuring that the paper is not too heavy. Additionally, you can experiment with different shapes and sizes of paper to find the best combination for maximum flight distance. 

**Q5: What is the best way to launch my paper airplane?**

**A5:** The best way to launch your paper airplane is to hold it at the very front and throw it with a quick, smooth motion. Make sure to release the plane at a slight upward angle for maximum flight distance.
