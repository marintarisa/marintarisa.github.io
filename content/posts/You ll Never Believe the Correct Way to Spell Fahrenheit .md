## History of Fahrenheit

Fahrenheit was developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 1700s. He based the scale on a series of experiments he conducted, and he set 0 degrees as the coldest temperature he could achieve with a mixture of ice, water and ammonium chloride. He set the boiling point of water at 212 degrees.

## Spelling of Fahrenheit

The correct spelling of Fahrenheit is "Fahrenheit" with an uppercase "F" and an uppercase "R". However, there are several other commonly used spellings, such as "Farenheit" and "Farhenheit".
