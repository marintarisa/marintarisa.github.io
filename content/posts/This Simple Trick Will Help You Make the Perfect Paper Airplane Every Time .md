## Definition of a Paper Airplane

A paper airplane is a type of model aircraft that is constructed out of paper or cardstock. It is typically made by folding the paper in a certain way to create an aerodynamic shape. Paper airplanes are usually flown as a form of amusement, but they can also be used in competitions to see who can make the best flying plane. 

## Benefits of Making Paper Airplanes

Making paper airplanes is a great way to have fun and practice your origami skills. It’s also a great way to teach kids about aerodynamics and the principles of flight. Plus, it’s a great way to spend time with your family or friends. 

## Overview of the Simple Trick

The trick we’re about to share will help you make the perfect paper airplane every time. It involves gathering the materials needed, folding the paper in a certain way, and adding the necessary details. With this simple trick, you’ll be able to make a plane that flies straight and true. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Gathering the materials needed: The first step is to gather the materials you’ll need to make the perfect paper airplane. You’ll need a sheet of paper or cardstock, a pair of scissors, and a ruler. 

2. Folding the paper: Once you have the materials, you’ll need to fold the paper in a certain way. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the corners in towards the center line. Finally, fold the paper in half widthwise. 

3. Adding the necessary details: Once the paper is folded, you’ll need to add the necessary details. This includes cutting out the wings, adding a tail, and adding a weight to the nose of the plane. 

## Conclusion

Making the perfect paper airplane doesn’t have to be difficult. With this simple trick, you’ll be able to make a plane that flies straight and true every time.
