## Introduction

Paper planes are a fun and easy way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. With just a few folds and a few adjustments, you can make your paper plane soar over 100 feet! In this blog post, we'll explain the benefits of making paper planes and provide step-by-step instructions for making your paper plane soar over 100 feet. 

## Definition of Paper Plane

A paper plane is a type of model aircraft made from paper or cardstock. It must be folded in a specific way to achieve the desired flight characteristics. Paper planes are an excellent way to explore the principles of aerodynamics and understand how air pressure and lift work. 

## Benefits of Making Paper Plane

Making paper planes is a great way to learn about aerodynamics and have fun at the same time. It's also a great way to bond with your family and friends. With just a few simple steps, you can make a paper plane that will soar over 100 feet! 

## Steps to Make Paper Plane Soar Over 100 Feet

### Step 1: Select the Right Paper

The type of paper you use is important for making a paper plane that will soar over 100 feet. You want to use a heavier paper, such as cardstock or construction paper. Avoid using thin paper, such as printer paper, as it won't provide the necessary lift. 

### Step 2: Fold the Paper

Folding the paper is the most important step for making a paper plane that will soar over 100 feet. You want to fold the paper in a specific way to create the necessary lift and air pressure. There are many different paper plane designs to choose from, so you can experiment to find the one that works best for you. 

### Step 3: Add Weight

Adding weight to the paper plane will help it soar over 100 feet. You can use coins or paper clips to add weight to the paper plane. Be sure to add the weight in the right places to ensure the plane has the right balance. 

### Step 4: Make Adjustments

Making adjustments to the paper plane is the final step for making it soar over 100 feet. You can adjust the angle of the wings and the position of the weight to get the desired flight characteristics. Experiment with different adjustments to get the best results. 

## Conclusion

Making a paper plane that will soar over 100 feet is easy with the right steps. By selecting the right paper, folding the paper in the right way, adding weight in the right places, and making adjustments, you can make a paper plane that will soar over 100 feet! So grab some paper and get ready to explore the principles of aerodynamics with your paper plane!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is this trick?**

**A1:** This trick is a simple modification to the design of a paper plane that will allow it to fly over 100 feet. 

**Q2: How do I make this modification?**

**A2:** To make this modification, you need to add a paper clip to the nose of the plane. This will make the plane more aerodynamic and allow it to fly further. 

**Q3: What kind of paper should I use?**

**A3:** The best type of paper to use is a thin and flexible paper, such as copy paper or printer paper. 

**Q4: What other materials do I need?**

**A4:** The only other material you need is a paper clip. 

**Q5: How long will the plane stay in the air?**

**A5:** The plane should stay in the air for a few seconds, depending on the speed and height of the throw.
