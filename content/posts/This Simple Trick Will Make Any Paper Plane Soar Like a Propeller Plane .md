## Introduction

There are few things more fun than making a paper plane and watching it soar through the air! But what if you could make your paper plane fly even further and faster than ever before? With this simple trick, you can make any paper plane soar like a propeller plane! 

## What is a Paper Plane?

A paper plane is a type of model aircraft that is made by folding a sheet of paper into a specific shape. Paper planes are usually used as toys, but they can also be used for scientific experiments or for teaching aerodynamics. 

## Benefits of Using a Paper Plane

Paper planes are a great way to have fun and learn about aerodynamics. They are also a great way to teach children about the basics of flight. They are also inexpensive and easy to make, so anyone can enjoy the fun of flying a paper plane!

## The Simple Trick

The trick to making any paper plane soar like a propeller plane is to add a small propeller to the front of the plane. This will give the paper plane more lift and allow it to fly further and faster than ever before! Here's how to do it:

1. Start by folding your paper into the shape of a paper plane.
2. Cut a small propeller shape out of a piece of cardboard.
3. Attach the propeller to the front of the paper plane with tape or glue.
4. Throw the paper plane and watch it soar!

## Materials Needed

To make this trick work, you will need: 

* A piece of paper
* A piece of cardboard
* Tape or glue

## Results

By adding a small propeller to the front of your paper plane, you can make it soar like a propeller plane! This trick will give your paper plane more lift and allow it to fly further and faster than ever before. 

## Advantages of Using This Trick

The advantages of using this trick are that it is inexpensive, easy to do, and will make your paper plane fly further and faster than ever before. 

## Potential Problems That Could Arise

When using this trick, it is important to make sure that the propeller is securely attached to the paper plane. If it is not properly secured, it could come off during flight and cause the paper plane to crash.
