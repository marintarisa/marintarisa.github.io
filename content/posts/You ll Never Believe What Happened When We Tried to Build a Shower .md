## Introduction

We recently decided to take on the challenge of building a shower from scratch. We had never done anything like it before, but we were excited to try something new and tackle a project that would give us a sense of accomplishment. 

## Background of the Story

We had recently moved into a new home and wanted to make some improvements. We decided to start with the bathroom, and that's when we came up with the idea of building a shower. We researched the materials and supplies we would need, and then we began the process of constructing our own shower. 

## Purpose of the Article

This article is meant to document the process of building a shower from the ground up. We will discuss the materials and supplies we used, the construction process, the installation of the plumbing, and the result of the project. Hopefully, our story will inspire others to take on similar projects and learn from our experience. 

## The Process of Building the Shower

### Gathering the Materials

The first step in building a shower was to gather the necessary materials. We needed to purchase tiles, grout, a shower pan, and the plumbing supplies. We spent a lot of time researching the different options available and making sure we had everything we needed before beginning the project. 

### Constructing the Shower

Once we had all of the materials, we began the process of constructing the shower. We had to make sure all of the tiles were cut to the right size and that the grout was properly applied. We also had to make sure that the shower pan was installed correctly so that it would be able to hold the water. 

### Installing the Plumbing

The final step in the process was to install the plumbing. This was a tricky part of the project, but with some patience and research, we were able to get it done. We made sure to double-check all of our connections and test the water pressure before we finished. 

## The Result of the Project

### The Finished Product

After a lot of hard work, our shower was finally finished! We were so proud of the end result, and it looked better than we ever could have imagined. We were relieved to have the project finished and to be able to finally enjoy our new shower. 

### The Lessons Learned

Building a shower was a great learning experience. We learned a lot about plumbing, tile installation, and construction. We also learned the importance of researching the materials and supplies we needed before starting the project. 

### The Overall Experience

Overall, building a shower was a great experience. We were able to take on a challenging project and complete it successfully. We are now more confident in our ability to tackle bigger projects in the future.
