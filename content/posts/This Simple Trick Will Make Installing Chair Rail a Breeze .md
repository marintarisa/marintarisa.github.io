# Introduction

Installing chair rail is a great way to add a decorative touch to any room. It can be a daunting task, however, if you don't know what you're doing. Fortunately, there is a simple trick that can make the process much easier. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of using this trick and provide a step-by-step guide to installing chair rail.

## Overview of Chair Rail Installation

Chair rail is a type of decorative trim that is installed along the walls of a room. It is typically installed at a height of 30-36 inches above the floor and is used to create a visual break between the wall and the furniture. Chair rail can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, plastic, and metal.

## Benefits of Using This Simple Trick

The simple trick we'll be discussing is the use of a level when installing chair rail. A level is a device that is used to ensure that the chair rail is installed in a straight line. This will ensure that the chair rail looks professional and will make the installation process much easier.

## Preparing for Installation

Before you can begin installing the chair rail, you will need to gather a few supplies. You will need a level, a measuring tape, a pencil, a saw, and the chair rail itself. Once you have all of the necessary supplies, you can begin the installation process.

## Measure and Mark the Wall

The first step in the installation process is to measure and mark the wall. You should measure the wall at the desired height of the chair rail and mark it with a pencil. This will ensure that the chair rail is installed at the correct height.

## Cut the Chair Rail to Size

Once you have marked the wall, you can use a saw to cut the chair rail to the desired length. Make sure to measure twice and cut once to ensure that the chair rail is cut to the correct size.

## Installing the Chair Rail

Now that you have the chair rail cut to size, you can begin the installation process. The first step is to use a level to ensure that the chair rail is installed in a straight line. This will ensure that the chair rail looks professional and is installed correctly.

Once you have confirmed that the chair rail is level, you can secure it to the wall using nails or screws. Make sure to use the appropriate type of fastener for the type of material that you are using.

## Finish the Installation

Once the chair rail is secured to the wall, you can finish the installation by filling in any gaps with caulk and painting the chair rail to match the rest of the room.

# Conclusion

Installing chair rail can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By using a level to ensure that the chair rail is installed in a straight line, you can make the installation process much easier. This simple trick will ensure that your chair rail looks professional and is installed correctly.
