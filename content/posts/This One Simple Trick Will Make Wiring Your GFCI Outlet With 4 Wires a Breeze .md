## Introduction

GFCI outlets are an important safety feature in any home. They help protect you and your family from electric shock by detecting any ground fault current in the circuit and quickly shutting off the power. Installing a GFCI outlet with four wires can be a daunting task, but this one simple trick will make it a breeze!

## Overview of GFCI Outlet

A GFCI outlet is an electrical outlet that is designed to protect people from electric shock. It works by detecting any ground fault current in the circuit and quickly shutting off the power. GFCI outlets can be used in place of a standard outlet, or they can be installed in addition to a standard outlet.

## Overview of 4 Wire Wiring

Installing a GFCI outlet with four wires requires connecting the hot, neutral, and ground wires, as well as an additional wire known as the “line” wire. The line wire is used to provide power to the GFCI outlet and must be connected to the “line” terminals.

## Step-by-Step Process

Installing a GFCI outlet with four wires is a simple process that can be completed in just a few steps. 

### Gather Necessary Materials

Before beginning the installation process, make sure you have all the necessary materials. You will need a GFCI outlet, a screwdriver, wire cutters, and wire nuts.

### Turn Off Power Supply

Before beginning any electrical work, make sure the power supply is turned off. This will help ensure your safety and prevent any damage to the outlet.

### Connect Wires to Outlet

Once the power is off, you can begin connecting the wires to the outlet. Start by connecting the hot wire to the “line” terminal and the neutral wire to the “neutral” terminal. Then, connect the ground wire to the “ground” terminal and the line wire to the “line” terminal. Finally, secure the wires with wire nuts.

## Conclusion

Installing a GFCI outlet with four wires can be a daunting task, but this one simple trick makes it a breeze! By following the steps outlined above, you can easily and safely install a GFCI outlet in your home. Not only will this help protect you and your family from electric shock, but it will also help you save money on your energy bills.
