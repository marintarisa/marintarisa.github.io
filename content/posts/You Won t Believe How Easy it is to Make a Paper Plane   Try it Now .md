## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is a paper plane?**

**A1:** A paper plane is a toy aircraft made out of a sheet of paper or cardboard. It is typically a flat object made by folding a sheet of paper or cardboard in half and then folding the edges in to create a symmetrical shape. 

**Q2: How do you make a paper plane?**

**A2:** Making a paper plane is easy and requires only a few simple steps. First, start with a rectangular sheet of paper. Fold the top two corners inwards towards the center of the paper. Next, fold the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the top two corners inwards again towards the center of the paper. Finally, fold the wings of the plane down and you have a paper plane! 

**Q3: What is the best way to make a paper plane fly?**

**A3:** The best way to make a paper plane fly is to adjust the wings of the plane to create lift. You can do this by bending the wings up or down to create an angle that will give the plane the lift it needs to fly. You can also adjust the shape of the wings to create more or less lift. 

**Q4: What is the farthest distance a paper plane can fly?**

**A4:** The farthest distance a paper plane can fly depends on the design of the plane and the environment in which it is flown. Generally, paper planes can fly up to several hundred meters, though some designs have been known to travel up to a kilometer or more. 

**Q5: Are there any special tricks to making a paper plane fly farther?**

**A5:** Yes, there are a few special tricks that can be used to make a paper plane fly farther. One of the most important tricks is to use a heavier paper, such as cardstock, to make the plane. Heavier paper will give the plane more lift and help it fly farther. Additionally, adjusting the wings of the plane to create more lift can also help the plane fly farther.
