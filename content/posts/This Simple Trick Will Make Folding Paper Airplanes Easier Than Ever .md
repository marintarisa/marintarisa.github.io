If you have ever wanted to make a paper airplane but felt intimidated by the process, you are not alone. However, this simple trick will make folding paper airplanes easier than ever! By following these easy steps, you will be able to make a perfect paper airplane in no time. First, you will need to choose a piece of paper that is at least 8.5 inches by 11 inches. Then, fold the paper in half lengthwise and crease the fold. Next, fold the paper in half again and crease the fold. After that, fold the top corners of the paper downward to meet the center crease. Finally, fold the paper in half one more time and crease the fold. Now you are ready to make your paper airplane! With this simple trick, folding paper airplanes is easier than ever. So go ahead and give it a try!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick that will make folding paper airplanes easier?**

**A1:** The simple trick is to use a ruler to help you fold the paper in half lengthwise, then in half again. This will create a crease that will make it easier to fold the paper into an airplane shape.

**Q2: How does the ruler help make folding easier?**

**A2:** The ruler helps create a sharp crease that makes it easier to fold the paper in the correct shape for an airplane. This crease helps keep the folds in place and makes the airplane look more symmetrical.

**Q3: What other tools can be used to help make folding paper airplanes easier?**

**A3:** You can also use a pair of scissors to help make the folds more precise. Additionally, a pair of tweezers can be used to help hold the paper in place while you are folding it.

**Q4: What is the best type of paper to use for folding paper airplanes?**

**A4:** The best type of paper to use is a medium weight paper, such as printer paper or construction paper. This type of paper is sturdy enough to hold its shape when folded, but not too thick that it will be difficult to fold.

**Q5: Are there any special techniques that can be used to make the paper airplane look more aerodynamic?**

**A5:** Yes, there are several techniques that can be used to make the paper airplane more aerodynamic. These include making sure the wings are even and symmetrical, and adding a tail fin to the back of the airplane. Additionally, making sure the folds are tight and precise will help the airplane fly better.
