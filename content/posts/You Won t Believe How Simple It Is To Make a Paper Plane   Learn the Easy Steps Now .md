## Introduction
A paper plane, also known as a "glider," is a type of aircraft that is made from a single sheet of paper. It is typically launched by throwing it into the air. Paper planes are often used as a form of entertainment and can be made in a variety of shapes and sizes.

## Benefits of Making a Paper Plane
Making a paper plane is a great way to have fun and show off your creative skills. It also teaches children the basics of aerodynamics and encourages them to think outside the box. Plus, it's an inexpensive way to have fun and can be done anywhere.

## Steps for Making a Paper Plane
Making a paper plane is simple and doesn't require any special tools or materials. Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

### Gather materials
You'll need a piece of paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler. You can also use a pen or marker to draw lines and decorations on the paper plane.

### Fold the paper
Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again, this time widthwise. Unfold the paper and you should have a crease in the center.

### Create the wings
Fold the top two corners of the paper inwards, so that they meet in the middle. Flip the paper over and fold the top two corners inwards again. This will create the wings of the paper plane.

### Adjust the wings
Adjust the wings by folding the edges inwards. This will help the paper plane fly better.

### Test the paper plane
Once you've finished making the paper plane, it's time to test it out! Throw the paper plane in the air and see how far it can go.
