## Definition of a Paper Airplane

A paper airplane is a type of glider made from a sheet of paper or cardstock. The paper is folded into a symmetrical shape, and then launched into the air. Paper airplanes are a great way to teach kids about the principles of flight and aerodynamics. 

## Overview of the Trick

This trick involves folding the paper in a specific way to create a paper airplane that will fly farther than any other paper airplane. It’s a simple trick that anyone can do, and it will make your paper airplane the envy of all your friends. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Gather Materials

To make the world’s longest-flying paper airplane, you’ll need a sheet of paper or cardstock, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. 

### Make the Body of the Plane

Fold the paper in half lengthwise and then unfold it. Then, fold the paper in half widthwise and unfold it again. Now, fold the paper in half diagonally from corner to corner and unfold it. 

### Create the Wings

Fold the paper in half lengthwise and then unfold it. Then, fold the top two corners down to the center line. Flip the paper over and repeat the process on the other side. 

### Add the Tail

Fold the bottom two corners up to the center line. Then, fold the paper in half lengthwise one more time. This will create the tail of the plane. 

## Conclusion

Making the world’s longest-flying paper airplane is easy with this simple trick. All you need is a sheet of paper, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. By following the step-by-step guide, you can create a paper airplane that will fly farther than any other. You’ll be the envy of all your friends!
