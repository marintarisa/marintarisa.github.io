## Introduction 

This is the story of one person's attempt to break the world record for longest flight time for a paper airplane. This person, who we will call John, had a passion for paper airplanes and wanted to see just how far he could push the limits of what was possible.

## Background of the Person Attempting the World Record

John had been making paper airplanes since he was a child, and had always been fascinated by their design and aerodynamics. He had become an expert at making paper airplanes and was always looking for ways to make them fly farther and longer. 

## Overview of the World Record Attempt

John decided to take his passion for paper airplanes to the next level by attempting to break the world record for longest flight time for a paper airplane. He set out to design a paper airplane that could fly for an extended period of time, and then he would attempt to break the world record.

## Details of the Attempt

John spent months designing and testing different paper airplane designs. He eventually settled on a design that he believed would be able to fly for an extended period of time. He then chose a location for the attempt, which was a large open field that would provide plenty of room for the paper airplane to fly. 

John then spent weeks preparing for the attempt. He practiced throwing the paper airplane and tested it in different wind conditions. He also made sure to bring plenty of extra paper and tape in case he needed to make any repairs or adjustments to the paper airplane during the attempt.

## Outcome of the Attempt

On the day of the attempt, John threw the paper airplane and it flew for an incredible 10 minutes and 12 seconds! This was far longer than any other paper airplane had flown before and it easily broke the world record. 

The crowd that had gathered to watch the attempt was amazed by the results and cheered loudly as the paper airplane flew. John was overwhelmed with joy and could not believe that he had actually broken the world record.
