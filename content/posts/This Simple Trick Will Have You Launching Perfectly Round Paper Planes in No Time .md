## Introduction

Paper planes are a classic pastime for kids and adults alike, but getting them to fly perfectly round and far is a challenge. Thankfully, there is a simple trick that, when followed, will have you launching perfectly round paper planes in no time!

## Overview of the Topic

The trick is to fold the paper in a specific way that creates a perfectly round shape and allows for maximum air resistance. This trick is easy to learn and can be done with any type of paper, including printer paper, construction paper, and even newspaper.

## Benefits of the Trick

The trick is beneficial because it makes it easier to launch paper planes that fly farther and stay in the air longer. It also makes it easier to control the direction of the paper plane and make it fly in a straight line.

## Overview of the Steps

The trick consists of six steps: gathering materials, folding the paper in half lengthwise, folding the paper in half again, making a triangle shape, folding the wings, and making the tail.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Gather materials: You will need one piece of paper, scissors, and tape (optional).

2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise: Take the piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise.

3. Fold the paper in half again: Take the folded paper and fold it in half again.

4. Make a triangle shape: Take the folded paper and make a triangle shape by folding the top corners down.

5. Fold the wings: Fold the top corners of the triangle down to create the wings.

6. Make the tail: Take the bottom corner of the triangle and fold it up to create the tail.

## Conclusion

In summary, launching perfectly round paper planes is easy with this simple trick. It consists of gathering materials, folding the paper in half lengthwise, folding the paper in half again, making a triangle shape, folding the wings, and making the tail. With this trick, you will be able to launch paper planes that fly farther and stay in the air longer. So give it a try and see how far your paper planes can fly!

If you have ever wanted to make a perfectly round paper plane, then this simple trick is for you! With just a few easy steps, you can have your paper plane soaring in no time. First, start with a square piece of paper. Fold the paper diagonally, so that you have a triangle. Next, fold the triangle in half, and then in half again. Now, you should have a small triangle shape. Fold the triangle in half one more time, and then unfold it. Finally, fold the two points of the triangle inwards and tuck them into the center. Now, you have a perfectly round paper plane that is ready to take flight! With this simple trick, you can have a perfectly round paper plane in no time and with minimal effort. So, get folding and get ready to launch!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to make perfectly round paper planes?**

**A1:** The trick is to use a circular template to fold the paper. This template can be made from cardboard or any other stiff material. Once the template is in place, simply fold the paper around the template and make sure the edges meet.

**Q2: How do you make the template?**

**A2:** To make the template, cut a circle out of cardboard or any other stiff material. Make sure the circle is slightly larger than the size of the paper plane you want to make.

**Q3: What types of paper can be used to make paper planes?**

**A3:** Any type of paper can be used to make paper planes, although heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper will fly better.

**Q4: How can you make the paper plane fly better?**

**A4:** To make the paper plane fly better, make sure the edges of the paper are folded tightly so that the plane is as aerodynamic as possible. Additionally, you can add weight to the nose of the plane to help it fly further.

**Q5: What other tips can help make the perfect paper plane?**

**A5:** Make sure to use a sharp crease when folding the paper. Also, experiment with different shapes and sizes of paper planes to find the one that flies best. Finally, practice makes perfect, so keep trying until you get the perfect paper plane!
