# This Simple Trick Will Make Your Paper Plane Soar Farther Than Ever Before!

Paper planes are a fun and easy way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. With just a few folds and a little bit of wind, you can make a paper plane that can soar through the sky. But what if you want your paper plane to go even farther? Follow this simple trick and you'll be able to make a paper plane that will fly farther than ever before! 

## Introduction to Paper Planes

Paper planes are a classic and timeless way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. All you need is a single sheet of paper and a few simple folds to make a paper plane that can soar through the sky. Paper planes can be made in a variety of shapes and sizes, from the classic dart to the more complex glider. With a little bit of practice, you can make a paper plane that can fly farther than ever before. 

## Overview of the Trick

This simple trick will help you make a paper plane that can fly farther than ever before. It involves folding the paper in a specific way and adding a few extra folds at the end to give the plane more lift. With a little bit of practice, you can make a paper plane that will soar through the sky. 

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1

The first step is to fold the paper in half lengthwise. Make sure to fold the paper tightly so that the two sides line up perfectly. Once the paper is folded, unfold it and repeat the process with the other side. 

### Step 2

The next step is to fold the paper in half widthwise. Again, make sure to fold the paper tightly so that the two sides line up perfectly. Once the paper is folded, unfold it and repeat the process with the other side. 

### Step 3

The last step is to add two extra folds at the end of the paper. Start by folding the top corner of the paper down to the bottom corner. Then fold the bottom corner up to the top corner. This will give the paper plane more lift, allowing it to soar farther than ever before. 

## Conclusion

This simple trick will help you make a paper plane that can fly farther than ever before. By folding the paper in a specific way and adding a few extra folds at the end, you can give the paper plane more lift and make it soar farther than ever before. With a little bit of practice, you can make a paper plane that will soar through the sky.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to making a paper plane soar farther?**

**A1:** The trick is to add two folds to the wings of the paper plane. This will create more lift and help the plane soar farther.

**Q2: What kind of paper should I use for this trick?**

**A2:** Any type of paper will work, but thicker paper will create more lift and help the plane soar farther.

**Q3: How do I add the two folds to the wings?**

**A3:** Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold each side of the paper inwards towards the center crease. This will create two folds on each wing.

**Q4: How much farther will this trick make my paper plane fly?**

**A4:** The exact distance will vary depending on the type of paper used, the weight of the paper, and other factors. However, this trick should help your paper plane fly farther than before.

**Q5: Are there any other tricks I can use to make my paper plane fly farther?**

**A5:** Yes! You can also try adding a tail to the back of the plane for more stability, or adding a nose weight to the front for more lift.
