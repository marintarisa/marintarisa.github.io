Paper planes are a fun, classic way to entertain yourself or your children. It's not always easy to make a perfect paper plane, though. Fortunately, with the right tools, you can make a perfect paper plane every time. All you need is A4 size paper and a few simple folding techniques.

To make a perfect paper plane, start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again, this time widthwise. Next, fold the top two corners down to the center crease. Finally, fold the bottom two corners up to the center crease.

Once you have the basic shape of the paper plane, you can add some finishing touches. To make the wings more aerodynamic, fold them slightly downwards. You can also adjust the nose of the plane to make it fly farther and straighter.

The key to making a perfect paper plane is practice. With a bit of trial and error, you'll be able to make a perfect paper plane every time. All you need is A4 size paper and a few simple folding techniques. With just a few minutes of practice, you'll be able to make a perfect paper plane every time.
