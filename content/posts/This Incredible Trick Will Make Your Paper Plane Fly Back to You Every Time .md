## Introduction 

Paper planes are a classic childhood activity that can bring hours of fun. But what if you could make your paper plane fly back to you every time? With this incredible trick, you can! 

## Definition of a Paper Plane

A paper plane, also known as a paper airplane, is a type of glider made out of folded paper. It is typically a flat sheet of paper that is folded into a shape that resembles an airplane. The most common type of paper plane is the dart, which is made by folding a sheet of paper in half twice and then folding the wings down.

## Benefits of This Trick

This trick is great for kids and adults alike! It allows you to have fun with paper planes without having to constantly chase after them. It also teaches kids how to adjust the wings and add weight to a paper plane, which are important concepts in aeronautics. 

## Steps to Make the Plane Fly Back to You

Making your paper plane fly back to you is easy! Here are the steps: 

### Folding the Plane

First, fold your paper in half twice to make a dart shape. Make sure the wings are even and that the folds are tight. 

### Adding Weight to the Plane

Next, add some weight to the plane. This can be anything from a paper clip to a penny. The weight should be placed in the center of the plane, near the nose. This will help the plane fly more steadily and make it easier to control. 

### Adjusting the Wings

Finally, adjust the wings of the plane. This can be done by bending the wings up or down to make the plane fly in the direction you want. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this trick is a great way to make your paper plane fly back to you every time. All you need to do is fold the paper, add some weight, and adjust the wings. With a little practice, youâ€™ll be able to make your paper plane fly back to you with ease!

**A1:** The trick is to fold the paper plane in a specific way. It should have a symmetrical shape and a wide, flat tail. You should also add a weight to the nose of the plane to make it more aerodynamic. When you throw the plane, aim for a high arc, and the plane should come back to you. 

**Q2: What materials are needed to make a paper plane?**

**A2:** You will need a sheet of paper and a small weight such as a paperclip or a penny. You may also need scissors, tape, or glue depending on the type of plane you are making. 

**Q3: Is there a specific way to fold the paper plane?**

**A3:** Yes, there is a specific way to fold the paper plane. You should fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the two sides up to meet in the middle. Then fold the top down to make a triangle shape. Finally, fold the two wings up and tuck them in. 

**Q4: How do you add the weight to the paper plane?**

**A4:** You can add the weight to the nose of the plane by taping or gluing it on. Make sure the weight is securely attached so that it does not come off during flight. 

**Q5: What is the best way to throw the paper plane?**

**A5:** The best way to throw the paper plane is to aim for a high arc. This will give the plane enough time to pick up enough speed and momentum to fly back to you.
