2. Consumer habits: Many people have similar consumer habits, from the clothes they wear to the food they eat.

3. Interests: Many people have similar interests and hobbies, from playing video games to watching movies.

2. Pursue a creative outlet: Find a creative outlet that you can use to express yourself and showcase your unique skills.

3. Develop a personal brand: Create a personal brand that reflects your values and interests and allows you to stand out from the crowd.
