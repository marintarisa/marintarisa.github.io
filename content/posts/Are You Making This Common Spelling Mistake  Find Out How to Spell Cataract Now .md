## Introduction to Cataracts 

Cataracts are a common vision disorder that can lead to vision loss. They occur when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy and opaque, blocking light from entering the eye and making it difficult to see clearly. Cataracts can affect people of all ages, but they are most common in older adults.

It can be easy to make a mistake when spelling cataract. In this article, we’ll take a look at the common spelling mistakes people make when spelling this word and provide tips on how to spell cataract correctly.

### Common Spelling Mistakes 

One of the most common spelling mistakes people make when spelling cataract is using the letter “e” instead of the letter “a”. This mistake is often made because the word “cataract” sounds similar to the word “elect”. Another common mistake is spelling the word as “cataracts” with an “s” at the end. This mistake is often made because people think that the word is plural.

The correct spelling of the word is “cataract” with one “a” and no “s” at the end.

### Causes of Cataracts 

Cataracts can be caused by a variety of factors, including age-related changes, exposure to sunlight, and diabetes. Age-related cataracts are the most common type and typically occur as people age. Exposure to sunlight can also cause cataracts to form over time. Diabetes can also increase a person’s risk of developing cataracts.

### Treatment for Cataracts 

Cataracts are usually treated with surgery. During the procedure, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens. In some cases, medication or eye drops may be prescribed to help reduce the symptoms of cataracts. It’s important to speak to your doctor about the best treatment option for you.

## Conclusion

Cataracts are a common vision disorder that can cause vision loss. It can be easy to make a mistake when spelling cataract, but the correct spelling is “cataract” with one “a” and no “s” at the end. Cataracts can be caused by a variety of factors, including age-related changes, exposure to sunlight, and diabetes.
