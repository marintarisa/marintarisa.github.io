## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the secret trick to making paper airplanes?**

**A1:** The secret trick to making paper airplanes is to fold the wings at a slight angle so that they create lift when the plane is thrown. This allows the plane to fly farther than it would if the wings were folded flat. Additionally, it's important to use a heavier paper when making paper airplanes as this will help the plane to stay in the air longer. 

**Q2: What kind of paper should be used to make the paper airplane?**

**A2:** The best kind of paper to use for making paper airplanes is a heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper. This type of paper is heavier and will help the plane stay in the air longer. Additionally, it's important to use a paper that is not too thick as this can make the plane too heavy and difficult to throw. 

**Q3: What is the best way to throw a paper airplane?**

**A3:** The best way to throw a paper airplane is to hold it by the nose and throw it with a smooth, even motion. This will help the plane to fly farther and stay in the air longer. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the wings of the plane are folded at a slight angle so that they create lift when the plane is thrown. 

**Q4: What are some tips for making a paper airplane fly farther?**

**A4:** Some tips for making a paper airplane fly farther include using a heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper, folding the wings at a slight angle to create lift, and throwing the plane with a smooth, even motion. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the plane is not too heavy as this can make it difficult to throw and cause the plane to not fly as far. 

**Q5: How can I make sure that my paper airplane will fly farther?**

**A5:** To make sure that your paper airplane will fly farther, it's important to use a heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper, fold the wings at a slight angle to create lift, and throw the plane with a smooth, even motion. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the plane is not too heavy as this can make it difficult to throw and cause the plane to not fly as far.
