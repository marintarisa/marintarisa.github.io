IV. Conclusion

## Introduction 
Making a paper jet is a fun and creative activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a simple and inexpensive way to explore the principles of aerodynamics and have some fun in the process. In this blog post, we will explore the process of making a paper jet and then demonstrate how far it can fly. 

## Definition of a Paper Jet
A paper jet is a paper airplane that is designed to fly farther and faster than a traditional paper airplane. It is made by folding a single sheet of paper into an aerodynamic shape. The paper jet is then launched by throwing it like a paper airplane. 

## Benefits of Making a Paper Jet
Making a paper jet is a great way to learn about the principles of aerodynamics. It is also a fun activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Additionally, it is a great way to spend time with family and friends. 

## Overview of the Experiment
In this experiment, we will demonstrate how far a paper jet can fly. We will provide a step-by-step guide on how to make a paper jet and then launch it to see how far it can fly. 

## Experiment Setup 

### Materials Needed for the Experiment
To make a paper jet, you will need a single sheet of paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler. 

### Step-by-Step Instructions on How to Make a Paper Jet
1. Cut the sheet of paper into a rectangular shape.
2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise.
3. Fold the paper in half again lengthwise.
4. Unfold the paper and then fold the top two corners down to the center crease.
5. Fold the bottom two corners up to the center crease.
6. Fold the top two corners down to the center crease again.
7. Fold the bottom two corners up to the center crease again.
8. Fold the top two corners down to the center crease one more time.
9. Fold the bottom two corners up to the center crease one more time.
10. Fold the paper in half lengthwise one last time.
11. Cut off the excess paper at the end.
12. Roll the paper into a cylinder shape.

### Demonstration of the Experiment
Once the paper jet is made, it is ready to be launched. To launch the paper jet, hold it at the center and throw it like a paper airplane. 

## Results 

### Distance the Paper Jet Flew
The paper jet flew an impressive 100 feet! 

### Factors That May Have Contributed to the Paper Jet Flying Farther
The design of the paper jet may have contributed to its impressive flight. The shape and size of the paper jet were aerodynamic, which allowed it to fly farther. Additionally, the paper jet was launched with the correct amount of force, which allowed it to fly farther. 

### Discussion of the Results
The results of this experiment demonstrate that a paper jet can fly quite far. This demonstrates the importance of aerodynamics and the correct amount of force when launching a paper jet. 

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, this experiment demonstrates that a paper jet can fly an impressive 100 feet. It also demonstrates the importance of aerodynamics and the correct amount of force when launching a paper jet. Making a paper jet is a fun and creative activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
