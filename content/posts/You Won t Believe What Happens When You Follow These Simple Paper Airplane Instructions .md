## Introduction

Paper airplanes are a fun and easy way to pass the time. Whether you’re a kid or an adult, they’re a great way to explore the principles of aerodynamics and have some fun. But if you don’t follow the right instructions, your paper airplane might not fly as far as it should. That’s why we’ve put together these simple paper airplane instructions that will help you create a paper airplane that flies with ease. 

## Background Information

Paper airplanes have been around for centuries. The earliest known paper airplane was created in 1845 by British aeronaut John Stringfellow. Since then, paper airplanes have been used for recreational purposes, as well as for scientific studies. They’ve been used to explore the principles of aerodynamics and to test the limits of flight.

## Purpose of the Paper Airplane Instructions

The purpose of these paper airplane instructions is to provide you with a step-by-step guide to creating a paper airplane that will fly with ease. We’ll show you how to choose the right materials, fold the paper correctly, and assemble the airplane. By following these instructions, you’ll be able to create a paper airplane that flies with accuracy and ease. 

## Steps to Making a Paper Airplane

### Step 1: Gather Materials

The first step in creating a paper airplane is to gather the necessary materials. You’ll need a piece of paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler. Once you have all of these items, you’re ready to begin. 

### Step 2: Fold the Paper

The next step is to fold the paper. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again. Finally, fold the paper in half one more time. This will create a triangle shape.

### Step 3: Assemble the Airplane

Once you’ve folded the paper, it’s time to assemble the airplane. Start by taping the two sides of the triangle together. Then, fold the bottom of the triangle up to create the wings. Finally, tape the wings together. 

## Benefits of Following These Instructions

By following these simple paper airplane instructions, you’ll be able to create a paper airplane that flies with accuracy and ease. Here are some of the benefits of following these instructions: 

### Increased Accuracy

By following these instructions, you’ll be able to create a paper airplane that is more accurate. This means that your paper airplane will fly farther and straighter than if you had not followed the instructions. 

### Improved Flight Performance
