### Types of soil

The type of soil you’re working with will determine the type of preparation you need to do. If the soil is sandy or clay-like, then it will need to be compacted before the slabs can be laid. If the soil is rocky or has a lot of organic matter, then it will need to be cleared away before the slabs can be laid.

### Tools and materials needed

Once you’ve assessed the type of soil you’re working with, you’ll need to gather the necessary tools and materials. This includes a shovel, rake, tamper, level, and sand or gravel.

## Installation

### Laying the slabs

The first step is to lay the slabs in the desired pattern. This can be done by starting at one corner of the area and working your way out in a straight line. It’s important to make sure that the slabs are level and that they’re not overlapping or leaving gaps.

### Leveling the slabs

Once the slabs have been laid, it’s important to make sure they’re level. This can be done using a level or a string line. If the slabs are not level, then it’s important to adjust them before moving on to the next step.

### Finishing touches

Once the slabs have been laid and leveled, it’s time to add the finishing touches. This involves filling in the gaps between the slabs with sand or gravel. This will help to ensure that the slabs stay level and that the area looks neat and tidy.
