This blog post will show you how to make a high-flying paper plane that will soar higher than ever before! 

## II. Steps to Make a High-Flying Paper Plane

1. Start with a rectangular piece of paper. The size and shape of the paper will determine the type of plane you can make. If you want to make a bigger plane, you can use a larger piece of paper. 

2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. This will form the plane’s body. 

3. Fold the body in half again. This will create the wings of the plane.

4. Fold the wings up so that they form a triangle shape. This will give the plane more stability in the air. 

5. Now it’s time to add the tail. Fold the end of the body up to create the tail. This will help the plane balance in the air. 

6. Finally, add a paper clip to the nose of the plane. This will act as a weight and help the plane fly farther. 

## III. Conclusion

Making a high-flying paper plane is easy and fun. All you need is a piece of paper, some scissors, and a paper clip. Follow these steps and you’ll have a plane that will soar higher than ever before! Have fun and happy flying!
