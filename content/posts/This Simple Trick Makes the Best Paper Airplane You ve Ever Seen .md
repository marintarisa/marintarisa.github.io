## Introduction 

Do you remember making paper airplanes as a kid? Whether you were a pro at folding the perfect plane or just a beginner, paper airplanes are a fun way to pass the time. But did you know that there's a simple trick that can make your paper airplane the best one you've ever seen? In this blog post, we'll discuss the simple trick that makes the best paper airplane and provide step-by-step instructions on how to make it. 

## What is a Paper Airplane? 

A paper airplane is a type of toy aircraft, usually made out of paper or cardboard, that is designed to fly when thrown. Paper airplanes are an easy and fun way to explore the principles of aerodynamics, which is the study of how air moves around objects. 

## Overview of the Trick 

The trick to making the best paper airplane is to use a technique called "tapered wings." This technique involves folding the paper in a way that creates a tapered wing shape, which helps the plane fly farther and faster. 

## How to Make the Best Paper Airplane 

Making the best paper airplane is easy and only requires a few simple steps. Here's what you'll need: 

- Paper 
- Scissors 
- Tape 

Now, let's get started: 

1. Cut a piece of paper into a rectangular shape. 
2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. 
3. Fold the top corners down to meet the center crease. 
4. Fold the bottom corners up to meet the center crease. 
5. Fold the wings up so that they are tapered. 
6. Secure the wings with tape. 

## Tips for Success 

When making your paper airplane, it's important to make sure that the wings are tapered evenly. This will help the plane fly farther and faster. Additionally, make sure to use strong tape to secure the wings. 

## Conclusion 

Making the best paper airplane is easy and fun. Not only will your plane fly farther and faster, but it will also look better than a regular paper airplane. So, the next time you want to make a paper airplane, try using the tapered wings technique for the best results.
