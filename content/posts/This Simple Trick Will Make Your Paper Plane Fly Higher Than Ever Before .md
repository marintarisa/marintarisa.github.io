## Introduction

Are you looking for a way to make your paper plane fly higher than ever before? Well, look no further! This simple trick will help you make your paper plane soar to new heights.

## Overview of the Topic

Paper planes are a fun and easy way to have some fun. They are also a great way to learn about aerodynamics and the principles of flight. With a few simple modifications, you can make your paper plane fly higher than ever before.

## Explanation of the Trick

The trick to making your paper plane fly higher is to make sure that it is as light as possible. This means that you should use lightweight materials such as tissue paper or thin cardstock. You should also make sure that the plane is balanced and that all of the wings are of equal size and shape.

## Demonstration of the Trick

Now that you know the basics of the trick, it's time to put it into action. Here are the steps to making your paper plane fly higher:

1. Start by folding a piece of paper in half lengthwise.
2. Fold the top corners down to the center crease.
3. Fold the bottom corners up to the center crease.
4. Fold the top edges in towards the center.
5. Fold the bottom edges in towards the center.
6. Fold the wings up at a slight angle.
7. Add a weight to the nose of the plane.

## Illustrations of the Process

To help you better understand the process, here are some illustrations of the steps:

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make a paper plane fly higher?**

**A1:** The simple trick to make a paper plane fly higher is to adjust the wings and tail to create a more aerodynamic shape. This will create more lift, allowing the plane to fly higher.

**Q2: What materials are needed to make a paper plane?**

**A2:** To make a paper plane, you will need a piece of paper, scissors, and tape.

**Q3: How do you adjust the wings and tail to create a more aerodynamic shape?**

**A3:** To adjust the wings and tail to create a more aerodynamic shape, you need to fold the wings and tail at different angles. This will create more lift, allowing the plane to fly higher.

**Q4: How long should a paper plane fly for?**

**A4:** A paper plane can fly for up to 10-20 seconds depending on the design and how it is thrown.

**Q5: Are there any other tricks to make a paper plane fly higher?**

**A5:** Yes, you can also adjust the weight of the plane by adding coins or paperclips to the nose. This will help the plane fly higher.
