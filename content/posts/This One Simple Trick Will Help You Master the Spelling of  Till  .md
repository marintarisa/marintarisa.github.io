## Introduction

Are you one of the many people who struggle with spelling the word "till"? If so, you're not alone! It can be difficult to remember whether it's spelled with one "l" or two, and the correct spelling often depends on the context. Fortunately, there's a simple trick that can help you master the spelling of this word.

## The Trick

The trick is to remember that the word "till" is usually used as a preposition, and it should be spelled with one "l". On the other hand, the word "until" is usually used as a conjunction, and it should be spelled with two "l"s. 

For example, you would use "till" in the phrase "I'll wait till the sun comes up," since "till" is a preposition in this case. Similarly, you would use "until" in the phrase "I'll wait until the sun comes up," since "until" is a conjunction in this instance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the trick to remember when spelling the word "till" is to use one "l" when it's used as a preposition and two "l"s when it's used as a conjunction. By following this simple rule, you'll never have to worry about the spelling of this word again! Plus, you'll have the added benefit of never having to second-guess yourself when writing or speaking.
