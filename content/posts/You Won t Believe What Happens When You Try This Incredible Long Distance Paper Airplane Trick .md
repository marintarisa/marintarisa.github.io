Have you ever wanted to make a paper airplane fly farther than ever before? Well, you won't believe what happens when you try this incredible long distance paper airplane trick!

## Definition of a Long Distance Paper Airplane

A long distance paper airplane is a specially designed paper airplane that is designed to fly farther than a traditional paper airplane. This type of paper airplane is usually made with heavier paper and is often aerodynamically designed to fly farther.

## Benefits of a Long Distance Paper Airplane Trick

The benefits of this trick are numerous. Not only will you be able to make your paper airplane fly farther, but you will also be able to learn more about the science of aerodynamics and the principles of flight. Additionally, it is a fun and creative way to spend time with friends and family.

## Overview of the Incredible Trick

The trick is simple. All you need to do is gather the materials, prepare the paper airplane, and execute the trick. We will explain each step in more detail below.

## How to Perform the Trick

### Gather the Materials

The materials you will need for this trick are simple. All you need is a sheet of paper, scissors, tape, and a marker.

### Prepare the Paper Airplane

Once you have gathered the materials, it is time to prepare the paper airplane. Begin by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again widthwise. Next, fold the paper in half diagonally. Finally, fold the paper in half again diagonally. This will create a paper airplane shape.

### Execute the Trick

Once you have prepared the paper airplane, it is time to execute the trick. Begin by taping the paper airplane to a wall. Then, take the marker and draw a line on the wall. This line should be at least 10 feet away from the paper airplane. Finally, stand back and throw the paper airplane.

## Results

### Expected Outcome

The expected outcome of this trick is that the paper airplane will fly across the room and hit the line you drew on the wall.

### Unexpected Outcome

The unexpected outcome of this trick is that the paper airplane will fly farther than you expected and hit the wall beyond the line you drew.

### Final Thoughts

This incredible long distance paper airplane trick is a great way to learn more about aerodynamics and the principles of flight. It is also a fun and creative way to spend time with friends and family. So why not give it a try and see how far your paper airplane can fly!
