## Preparing for Installation

Before you start installing pavers, you’ll need to prepare the area. This includes measuring and marking the area, excavating and leveling the ground, and adding a base layer of gravel.

### Measuring and Marking the Area

The first step is to measure and mark the area where you plan to install the pavers. This will help ensure that the pavers are installed in the correct location.

### Excavating and Leveling the Ground

Once you’ve marked the area, you’ll need to excavate the ground and level it. This will help ensure that the pavers are installed on a flat surface.

## Installing the Pavers

Once the area is prepared, you’re ready to start installing the pavers. This includes laying the pavers, filling joints with sand, and sealing the pavers.

### Laying the Pavers

The first step is to lay the pavers in the desired pattern. This can be done by hand or with a paver installation tool.

### Filling Joints with Sand

Once the pavers are laid, you’ll need to fill the joints with sand. This will help keep the pavers in place and prevent them from shifting over time.

### Sealing the Pavers

Once the pavers are installed and the joints are filled with sand, you’ll need to seal the pavers. This will help protect them from the elements and prevent them from fading or cracking over time.
