Making paper airplanes is a fun activity for kids of all ages, and with this simple trick, you can make paper airplanes that can carry coins. With just a few simple supplies, you can have your own paper airplanes that can carry coins in no time. All you need is a sheet of paper, scissors, and some coins. First, fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold it again. Make sure the folds are tight. Then, cut the paper in half. Take one of the halves and fold it in half again, and then fold it in half once more. This will give you four equal sections. Take the first section and fold it in half again. This will create a pocket that can hold the coins. Place the coins inside the pocket and then fold the other sections over the pocket. Finally, fold the wings of the paper airplane and you are ready to go. With this simple trick, you can make paper airplanes that can carry coins in no time. Now you can have fun with your friends and family as you fly your paper airplanes and compete to see who can carry the most coins.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick for making paper airplanes that can carry coins?**

**A1:** The trick is to make the airplane with a flat surface on the bottom of the wings. This will create a pocket that can hold a coin.

**Q2: What type of paper should be used for the airplane?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use is a heavy cardstock or construction paper. This will give the airplane more stability and strength.

**Q3: How do you make the pocket for the coin?**
