## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick?**

**A1:** The trick is to make a paper airplane that does a loop-the-loop.

**Q2: How do you make the paper airplane?**

**A2:** To make the paper airplane, you will need a piece of paper, scissors, and tape. Fold the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the two sides in to meet in the middle. Make a triangle at the front of the plane, and fold the back of the plane up to meet the triangle. Secure the folds with tape.

**Q3: What do you need to do the trick?**

**A3:** To do the trick, you will need a large open space with plenty of room to fly the plane. You will also need enough wind to keep the plane in the air.

**Q4: What is the best way to launch the plane?**

**A4:** The best way to launch the plane is to hold it at its center of gravity, then throw it with a quick, smooth motion.

**Q5: What should you do if the plane doesn't stay in the air?**

**A5:** If the plane doesn't stay in the air, you may need to adjust the balance of the plane or increase the wind. You may also need to adjust the angle of the plane's wings or add more tape to make the plane more aerodynamic.
