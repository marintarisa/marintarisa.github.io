## Step-by-Step Process 
Now that you know the basics of tiling over tile, let's walk through the step-by-step process. 

### Step One: Clean the Surface 
The first step is to thoroughly clean the existing tile. This will help ensure that the new tiles adhere properly to the surface. Use a vacuum and/or a mop to remove any dirt, dust, or debris. 

### Step Two: Apply Adhesive 
Once the surface is clean, you'll need to apply an adhesive to the existing tile. This will help ensure that the new tiles stay in place. Use a notched trowel to spread the adhesive evenly across the surface. 

### Step Three: Place the New Tile 
Once the adhesive has been applied, you can begin placing the new tiles. Start in one corner and work your way out. Make sure to use spacers to ensure that the tiles are evenly spaced. 

### Step Four: Grout the Joints 
Once the tiles are in place, you'll need to grout the joints. This will help ensure that the tiles are properly sealed and will help prevent water from seeping through the joints. Use a grout float to apply the grout and a damp sponge to wipe away the excess. 

### Step Five: Seal the Tile 
The last step is to seal the tiles. This will help protect the tiles from dirt and moisture and will help ensure that they last for years to come. Use a sealer specifically designed for tile and follow the manufacturer's instructions for best results.
