In this blog post, we’ll look at what “still” means, why people struggle to spell it, and some tips to help you remember the correct spelling. 

## Definition of “Still”

The word “still” has a few different meanings, but the most common usage is as an adverb. This means it’s used to describe an action or event that is not changing or moving. For example, you could say “The river is still” to describe a river that is not flowing. It can also be used to describe something that is not changing in terms of size, shape, or quantity. For example, you could say “The box is still full” to describe a box that still has the same amount of items in it.

## Reasons Why People Struggle to Spell “Still”

One of the main reasons why people struggle to spell “still” is because it looks like it should be spelled “stil”. This is because the double “L” is often difficult for people to remember, and it can be easy to forget that the second “L” is there. Another reason why people struggle to spell “still” is because it looks like it should be spelled with two “I”s instead of one. This is because the “I” and “L” can look similar when written down.

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistake people make when spelling “still” is to leave out the second “L” and spell it “stil”. Another common mistake is to spell it with two “I”s instead of one, resulting in “stiil”. People also sometimes spell it with an extra “E” at the end, resulting in “stille”.

## Reasons Why These Mistakes are Made

The main reason why these mistakes are made is because people often forget that the second “L” is there. This is because the “L” and “I” can look similar when written down, and it can be easy to forget that the second “L” is there. People also sometimes forget that there is only one “I” in the word, resulting in them adding an extra “I”.

## Tips to Remember the Correct Spelling

The best way to remember the correct spelling of “still” is to use mnemonics. A mnemonic is a phrase or sentence that helps you remember something, and for “still” a good mnemonic is “Still waters run deep”. This phrase can help you remember that there are two “L”s in the word.

Another way to remember the correct spelling of “still” is to break it down into syllables. The word “still” is made up of two syllables, “stil” and “l”. This can help you remember that there is an extra “L” at the end of the word.
