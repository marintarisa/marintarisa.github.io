If you've ever wanted to make a paper plane that soars, then this simple trick is for you. With just a few easy steps, you can make a paper plane that will defy gravity and fly further than you ever imagined. All you need is a sheet of paper and a few moments of your time. First, fold the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again, this time widthwise. Next, fold the corners in towards the center of the paper. Finally, make two small folds near the center of the plane, and you're done! You won't believe how easy it is to make a paper plane that will soar through the air. So grab a sheet of paper and give it a try!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
## Q1: What is the simple trick to make your paper plane soar?

**A1:** The simple trick is to fold the wings of the paper plane in a specific way to create an aerodynamic shape. This will help your paper plane fly farther and faster. 

## Q2: How do you fold the wings of the paper plane?

**A2:** First, fold the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the top corners of the paper inwards so that they meet in the middle. Finally, fold the top corners of the paper inwards again so that they meet in the middle. This will create an aerodynamic shape for the wings of your paper plane. 

## Q3: What other tips can I use to make my paper plane soar?

**A3:** You can also adjust the angle of the wings and the tail of the paper plane to make it fly better. Additionally, make sure to use a smooth paper that is not too thick or too thin. This will help the paper plane fly straight and fast. 

## Q4: How do I adjust the angle of the wings and the tail of the paper plane?

**A4:** To adjust the angle of the wings, fold the top corners of the paper inwards at a slight angle. To adjust the angle of the tail, fold the bottom corner of the paper inwards at a slight angle. This will help the paper plane fly farther and faster. 

## Q5: Is there anything else I can do to make my paper plane soar?

**A5:** Yes, you can also add weights to the nose of the paper plane. This will help the paper plane fly farther and faster. Additionally, you can experiment with different shapes and sizes of the paper plane to see which one flies the best.
