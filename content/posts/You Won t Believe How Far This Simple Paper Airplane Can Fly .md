## I. Introduction 

Have you ever wanted to fly a paper airplane? If so, you’re in for a treat. We recently discovered a paper airplane that can fly an impressive distance, and you won’t believe how far it can go! 

## II. Design of the Paper Airplane

The paper airplane is made from one sheet of 8.5x11 inch paper. It is designed with two wings and a long tail for stability. The wings are curved to create lift and the tail is designed to keep the plane on course. 

## III. Flight Record of the Paper Airplane

We tested the paper airplane by launching it off a three-story building. Amazingly, it flew over 300 feet! We couldn’t believe our eyes. We tested the paper airplane several more times and each time it flew farther than the last. 

We are excited to share this amazing paper airplane with you. We know you’ll have a blast launching it and seeing how far it can fly. So grab a sheet of paper and get ready to take flight!
