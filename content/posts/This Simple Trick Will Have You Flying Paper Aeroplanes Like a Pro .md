## Introduction

Do you remember the days of making paper aeroplanes and trying to get them to fly? It was always a challenge to make them just right, so they could soar through the air. Well, now you can make paper aeroplanes that really fly!

## Learning the Basics

The key to making paper aeroplanes that really fly is to start with the basics. Begin by folding a piece of paper into a triangle, then fold the triangle in half. This will create two wings that will help the plane stay in the air.

Next, make sure the wings are of equal size and shape. This will help the plane fly in a straight line. You can also add a tail to the back of the plane to help it stay balanced.

## Mastering the Technique

Once you have mastered the basics, it’s time to move on to the more advanced techniques. You can make the wings of your plane longer or shorter, depending on how far you want it to fly. You can also add weight to the nose of the plane to help it fly further.

Finally, make sure you throw the plane correctly. You want to give it a good, strong throw so it has enough momentum to stay in the air.

## Conclusion

Making paper aeroplanes can be a lot of fun, and with a bit of practice, you’ll be flying them like a pro! So grab a piece of paper and start folding!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to fly paper aeroplanes like a pro?**

**A1:** The simple trick to fly paper aeroplanes like a pro is to use the right paper, fold the paper correctly, and adjust the balance of the plane.

**Q2: What type of paper should I use to make paper aeroplanes?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use for paper aeroplanes is lightweight, thin paper such as printer paper or copier paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper can be too heavy and cause the plane to lose lift. 

**Q3: How should I fold the paper to make the best paper aeroplane?**

**A3:** To make the best paper aeroplane, you should fold the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the top corners down to meet the center line. Next, fold the bottom corners up to meet the center line. Finally, fold the wings down to create the aeroplane shape. 

**Q4: How can I adjust the balance of the plane?**

**A4:** To adjust the balance of the plane, you should adjust the weight by adding paperclips or small pieces of tape to the nose or tail of the plane. This will help the plane to fly straight and stay in the air longer. 

**Q5: What other tips can I use to make my paper aeroplanes fly better?**

**A5:** Other tips for making your paper aeroplanes fly better include making sure the wings are even and symmetrical, using a smooth throwing motion, and aiming the plane slightly upwards when throwing.
