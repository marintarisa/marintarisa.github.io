### A. Definition of a Paper Plane

A paper plane is a type of aircraft that is constructed from a single sheet of paper or cardstock. It is usually constructed by folding the paper in a specific manner so that it will fly. Paper planes are a great way to explore the principles of flight and have fun.

### B. Benefits of Making a Paper Plane

Making a paper plane is a great way to have fun and let your creativity take flight. It is also a great way to explore the principles of flight and learn about aerodynamics. Plus, it's a great way to pass the time and have some fun.

## II. Steps for Making a Paper Plane

Making a paper plane is easy and only requires a square piece of paper. Here are the five simple steps for making a paper plane:

### A. Step 1: Fold the Paper in Half

The first step is to fold the paper in half lengthwise. This will create a crease that will be used as a guide for the rest of the folds.
