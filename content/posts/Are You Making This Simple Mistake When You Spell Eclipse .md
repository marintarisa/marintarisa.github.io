Eclipses are a fascinating phenomenon that have been studied for centuries. But it turns out that many people make some common mistakes when they spell eclipse. In this blog post, we’ll go over three of the most common mistakes people make when they spell eclipse and how to avoid them.

### Introduction

First, let’s define what an eclipse is. An eclipse is an astronomical event when one celestial body (such as the moon or sun) passes in front of another celestial body. There are two types of eclipses – solar and lunar. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, while a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon.

### Common Mistake #1: Confusing an Eclipse with a Solar Eclipse

One of the most common mistakes people make when spelling eclipse is confusing an eclipse with a solar eclipse. A solar eclipse is a specific type of eclipse that occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun. While all solar eclipses are eclipses, not all eclipses are solar eclipses. For example, a lunar eclipse is an eclipse that occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon. 

### Common Mistake #2: Confusing an Eclipse with a Lunar Eclipse

Another common mistake people make when spelling eclipse is confusing an eclipse with a lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse is a specific type of eclipse that occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon. While all lunar eclipses are eclipses, not all eclipses are lunar eclipses. For example, a solar eclipse is an eclipse that occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun.

The last common mistake people make when spelling eclipse is not capitalizing the word “eclipse”. Since “eclipse” is a proper noun, it should always be capitalized. Not capitalizing the word “eclipse” can lead to confusion and can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence.
