## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to make your own plane but thought it was too hard? Well, you're in luck! With just a few simple materials, you can make your own glider plane in no time. 

## What Is a Glider Plane?
A glider plane is a type of aircraft that is designed to fly without an engine. The wings of a glider plane are designed to create lift, allowing the plane to glide through the air. Glider planes can be made from a variety of materials, including paper. 

## Benefits of Making a Glider Plane
Making a glider plane is a great way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. It is also a fun way to spend an afternoon. Plus, you can take your glider plane outside and watch it soar through the air. 

## Materials Needed
To make a glider plane, you will need: 
- Paper 
- Scissors 
- Tape 

## Steps to Make a Glider Plane
1. Cut the Paper: Cut a piece of paper into a rectangle shape. The size of the rectangle will depend on how big you want your glider plane to be. 

2. Fold the Paper: Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half widthwise. 

3. Attach the Wings: Cut two small triangles out of the paper. These will be the wings of your glider plane. Tape the wings to the body of the plane. 

4. Test Out the Glider Plane: Take your glider plane outside and give it a test run. See how far it can fly! 

Making a glider plane out of paper is a fun and easy activity. With just a few simple materials, you can make your own glider plane in no time. So grab some paper and scissors and get to work!
