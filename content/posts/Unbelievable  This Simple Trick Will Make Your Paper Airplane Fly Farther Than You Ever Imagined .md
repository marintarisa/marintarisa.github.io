A paper airplane is a toy aircraft, usually made out of paper, that is designed to be flown in the air. Paper airplanes are usually made by folding a sheet of paper into a symmetrical shape, and then adding weight to the nose to make it fly better.

## Benefits of a Paper Airplane
Paper airplanes are a great way to have fun and learn about aerodynamics. They are also a great way to teach children about the principles of flight. Paper airplanes are also a great way to bond with friends and family.

## Overview of the Simple Trick
This simple trick will help you to make your paper airplane fly farther than you ever imagined. The trick involves folding the paper into an airplane shape, making sure the wings are even, and then adding weight to the nose of the plane.

## How to Make Your Paper Airplane Fly Farther

### Step 1: Fold the paper into an airplane shape
The first step is to fold the paper into an airplane shape. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the edges in towards the center line. Finally, fold the paper in half again and crease the edges to make the wings.

### Step 2: Make sure the wings are even
The next step is to make sure that the wings are even. To do this, hold the paper up to the light and make sure that the wings are the same size and shape. If they aren't, then adjust the folds until they are.

### Step 3: Add weight to the nose of the plane
The final step is to add weight to the nose of the plane. This will help the plane to fly farther and stay in the air longer. You can use a paperclip, a penny, or a small piece of lead to add weight to the nose of the plane.
