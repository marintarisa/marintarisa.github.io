Next, fold the paper in half again, but this time make sure to crease it at an angle. Finally, cut the paper along the crease you made. This will create two flaps that you can use to fold the paper into a plane. With a little practice, you’ll be an expert at making paper planes in no time. So, go ahead and give it a try – you won’t regret it!</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faq--1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#frequently-asked-questions-faq--1>#</a></h2><p><strong>Q1: What is the trick to making a paper plane?</strong></p><p><strong>A1:</strong> The trick to making a paper plane is to fold the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the top two corners down to meet the center crease.
